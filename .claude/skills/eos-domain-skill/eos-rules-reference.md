## The Six Key Components

Every organization has exactly six components. When each is strengthened to 80%+ effectiveness, the organization becomes a "well-oiled machine."

1. **Vision** — Everyone sees and shares the same vision
2. **People** — Right people in the right seats
3. **Data** — Managed by a handful of objective numbers
4. **Issues** — Identified, discussed, and solved for the long term
5. **Process** — Core processes documented and followed consistently
6. **Traction** — Discipline and accountability through Rocks and Meeting Pulse

---

## Rocks

### Definition
Rocks are the 3-7 most important priorities for the next 90 days. They are distinct from day-to-day responsibilities and to-dos.

### Rules
- **Quantity:** Company has 3-7 Rocks per quarter (closer to 3 is better). Leadership team members have 3-7 each. All other employees have 1-3.
- **Duration:** Exactly 90 days. Due dates align with quarter ends (Mar 31, Jun 30, Sep 30, Dec 31).
- **Ownership:** Each Rock is owned by exactly ONE person. "When more than one person is accountable, no one is accountable."
- **Format:** Must be specific, measurable, and attainable. At quarter end, there must be zero ambiguity whether it was done or not.
- **Good example:** "Close $1 million in new business" / "Hire a new controller" / "Document delivery process and train all"
- **Bad example:** "Start working on the Customer Service Process" (not specific, not measurable)
- **No new Rocks mid-quarter.** Once set, no new priorities can be added. New ideas go on the V/TO Issues List for next quarter.
- **Review cadence:** Weekly in the L10 meeting. Status is "on track" or "off track" only — no discussion during review.
- **Completion target:** 80% completion rate per quarter is the standard. 100% is perfectionist thinking. Below 80% requires root cause analysis.
- **Incomplete Rocks** have three options: (1) carry forward to next quarter, (2) if 95%+ done, remaining work becomes a to-do, (3) reassign to someone else.

### Rocks vs. To-Dos
| Attribute | Rock | To-Do |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Duration | 90 days | 7 days |
| Scope | Strategic priority | Action item |
| Count | 3-7 per person (leadership), 1-3 (everyone else) | Unlimited |
| Review | Weekly "on track" / "off track" | Weekly "done" / "not done" |

---

## Scorecard

### Definition
A handful of numbers (5-15) that tell you at a glance how your business is doing. Activity-based leading indicators, not trailing indicators like P&L.

### Rules
- **Quantity:** 5-15 numbers for the leadership team Scorecard. Fewer is better.
- **Frequency:** Reviewed weekly. Numbers reported weekly, not monthly or quarterly.
- **Review format:** Read down the list. Each number is "on track" or "off track" only. If off track, drop to the Issues List. NO DISCUSSION during Scorecard review.
- **Time limit:** 5 minutes maximum in the L10 meeting.
- **Goal:** Every number must have a goal/target to measure against.
- **Ownership:** Every number has exactly one owner responsible for reporting it.
- **Leading indicators:** Scorecard tracks activity (calls made, proposals sent) not just results (revenue). Activity precedes results.
- **Ultimate goal:** Everyone in the organization eventually has a number — a "meaningful, manageable measurable."
- **Trailing indicators warning:** P&L statements come after the fact. A Scorecard lets you "change the future" by tracking activity in real time.

## Issues (IDS)

### Definition
Issues are obstacles that prevent the organization from achieving its vision. The IDS (Identify, Discuss, Solve) process is the discipline for resolving them.

### The Three Issues Lists
1. **V/TO Issues List** — Long-term issues that can be shelved beyond 90 days. Tackled in quarterly meetings.
2. **Weekly Leadership Issues List** — Issues for the current week's L10 meeting. Solved within 7 days or escalated.
3. **Departmental Issues List** — Issues within each department team.

### IDS Rules
- **Identify:** Name the real, root-cause issue — not the symptom. "Most of the time, the stated problem is not the real one." Dig deeper.
- **Discuss:** Everyone shares all perspectives openly and honestly. No tangents. No politics. Discussion happens only in the IDS portion of the meeting, not during Scorecard or Rock review.
- **Solve:** Make a decision and create a plan of attack (to-dos). Move to action — "the solution is usually simpler than you think."
- **Priority order:** Always identify the top 3 issues first by priority, then solve #1 before moving to #2. Do NOT work top-to-bottom on the list. Solving the most important issue often resolves other issues that were symptoms.
- **Tangent alert:** "When someone goes off on a tangent, gently bring them back by repeating the issue."
- **Resolution types:** A solved issue results in one or more to-dos on the To-Do List. If it can't be solved this week, it stays on the Issues List or moves to the V/TO Issues List.
- **10 Commandments of Solving Issues:**
  1. Thou shalt not rule by consensus
  2. Thou shalt not be a weenie
  3. Thou shalt be decisive
  4. Thou shalt not rely on secondhand information
  5. Thou shalt fight for the greater good
  6. Thou shalt not try to solve them all
  7. Thou shalt live with it, end it, or change it
  8. Thou shalt choose short-term pain and long-term gain
  9. Thou shalt enter the danger
  10. Thou shalt take a shot

### Environment Rules
- Open and honest culture is a prerequisite. "No one has ever died from being open about issues."
- Trust must exist. If the leadership team isn't healthy, the organization won't be.
- Issues are NOT negative. "The sooner you can admit you have them and not view that as negative thinking or weakness, the faster you'll move forward."

---

## To-Dos

### Definition
Seven-day action items that create weekly accountability.

### Rules
- **Duration:** Must be completable within 7 days.
- **Review:** Weekly in L10 — status is "done" or "not done" only.
- **Retention:** Should not remain on the To-Do List for more than 2 weeks.
- **Completion rate:** 90% of to-dos should be completed ("drop off") every week.
- **Source:** To-dos typically result from solving issues in IDS, or from commitments made during the week.
- **Distinction from Rocks:** If an action implies a longer timeframe, it should be a Rock, not a to-do.

## Level 10 (L10) Meeting

### Definition
The weekly 90-minute leadership team meeting. The "heartbeat" of the organization.

### Agenda (90 minutes, hard stop)
| Segment | Time | Rules |
|---------|------|-------|
| Segue | 5 min | Personal/professional good news. NO work problems. Builds human connection. |
| Scorecard | 5 min | Read numbers. "On track" or "off track" only. Off track → drop to Issues. NO DISCUSSION. |
| Rock Review | 5 min | Each Rock: "on track" or "off track." Off track → drop to Issues. NO DISCUSSION. |
| Customer/Employee Headlines | 5 min | Short headlines, good or bad. Issues → drop to Issues List. |
| To-Do List | 5 min | Review last week's to-dos: "done" or "not done." Strike completed items. |
| IDS | 60 min | Identify top 3 issues by priority. Solve #1 first. Follow IDS track. This is where the magic happens. |
| Conclude | 5 min | (1) Recap new To-Do List. (2) Decide what to communicate to org. (3) Rate meeting 1-10 (goal: 8+). |

### L10 Rules
- **Start on time.** "Early is on time, on time is late." (Lombardi rule)
- **End on time.** No overruns. Prevents domino effect on schedules.
- **Never cancel.** Only acceptable reasons to miss: vacation or death. If someone can't attend, the meeting still happens.
- **Same day, same time, every week.** Consistency creates the "buildup" effect.
- **Devices off.** Disconnect from day-to-day during the meeting.
- **Two required roles:** (1) Someone runs the meeting (keeps on track). (2) Someone manages the agenda (updates Scorecard, Rock Sheet, To-Do/Issues Lists).
- **One-page agenda.** Agenda, to-dos, and Issues List fit on one sheet. No meeting minutes needed — the agenda IS the record.
- **No tangents.** If discussion starts during reporting segments, the facilitator drops the item to IDS.
- **Rating goal:** Average meeting rating should be 8+ out of 10.

## Quarterly Meeting

### Structure
- **Who:** Leadership team
- **Where:** Off-site (mandatory — too many distractions at the office)
- **Duration:** 8 hours (full day)
- **Frequency:** Every 90 days, pre-scheduled
- **Never skip.** Even when things seem fine. "I can't tell you how many times I've heard 'Wow, and I didn't think we'd have anything to talk about!'"

### Agenda
1. **Segue** — Best business/personal news (90 days), what's working/not working, expectations for the day
2. **Review Previous Quarter** — Numbers and Rocks. Each Rock: "done" or "not done." Target 80%+ completion.
3. **Review V/TO** — Refresh the vision. Discuss until everyone is on the same page.
4. **Establish Next Quarter's Rocks** — Follow the 8-step Rock-setting process.
5. **Tackle Key Issues** — IDS remaining issues in order of priority.
6. **Next Steps** — Who does what, messages to communicate.
7. **Conclude** — Feedback, expectations met?, rate meeting 1-10 (goal: 8+).

## Vision/Traction Organizer (V/TO)

### Definition
A two-page document that captures the entire vision on paper. "Eight questions that, when answered, will give you absolute clarity."

### The Eight Questions
1. **Core Values** — 3-7 values that define the organization's culture. Used as hiring/firing criteria.
2. **Core Focus** — Purpose/Cause/Passion + Niche (what you do best). Defines the "sweet spot."
3. **10-Year Target** — One big, long-term goal (BHAG). Inspirational direction.
4. **Marketing Strategy** — Target market, 3 Uniques, Proven Process, Guarantee.
5. **3-Year Picture** — Revenue, profit, measurables, and "what does it look like?" Vivid description.
6. **1-Year Plan** — Revenue, profit, measurables, and 3-7 goals for the year.
7. **Quarterly Rocks** — The 3-7 most important 90-day priorities.
8. **Issues List** — Long-term issues to solve in future quarters.

## People: Right People, Right Seats

### The People Analyzer
A tool that evaluates whether someone shares your core values. Each person is rated on each core value:
- **+** = Most of the time exhibits the value
- **+/-** = Sometimes exhibits the value
- **-** = Rarely exhibits the value

**The bar:** Typically, the minimum acceptable standard is "+" on most values and "+/-" on the rest. Anyone with a "-" on any core value is likely the wrong person.

### GWC (Get It, Want It, Capacity to Do It)
Evaluates whether someone is in the right seat:
- **Get It:** They understand the role intuitively
- **Want It:** They genuinely want to do the work
- **Capacity:** They have the mental, physical, emotional, and time capacity

All three must be "yes" for someone to be in the right seat. If any one is "no," they're in the wrong seat.

### Accountability Chart (not Org Chart)
- Defines function and outcome ownership, not hierarchy
- Structure first, people second — design the ideal structure before placing people
- Five major functions typically: Marketing/Sales, Operations, Finance, plus Integrator and Visionary
- Every seat has 5 roles (major responsibilities) — no more
- "Two people in one seat" is never acceptable — it diffuses accountability

### The Visionary and Integrator Roles
- **Visionary:** Creative, idea-rich, culture-focused, big-picture relationships, R&D
- **Integrator:** Manages P&L, holds leadership accountable, removes obstacles, executes business plan, tie-breaker
- These are the two most critical seats. The V/I relationship is "the most important in EOS."

---

## Process: The 20/80 Rule

### Rules
- Document the 20% of steps that drive 80% of results
- Typically 6-10 core processes for the whole company
- Each process documented in 1-3 pages max (not manuals)
- Three steps: (1) Identify core processes, (2) Document each one, (3) Package and train everyone — "Followed By All" (FBA)
- Technology must improve your "Way" — research and decide based on efficiency and simplification, not hype

---

## Key Principles

- **"As goes the leadership team, so goes the company."** — Leadership health determines organizational health.
- **"One vision, one voice, one culture, one operating system."** — No hybrid systems.
- **"Less is more."** — Applies to Rocks, Scorecard metrics, core processes, and meeting agendas.
- **"Hitting the ceiling is inevitable."** — Growth comes in spurts by breaking through ceilings.
- **"You can't build a great organization on multiple operating systems."** — Commit fully or don't start.
- **"The issues are the same, your ability to solve them changes."** — Every business has the same categories of problems.
- **80% rule:** 80% completion on Rocks, 80% strength on each component. Perfectionism is the enemy.
