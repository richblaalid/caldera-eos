# Chapter 8: The Traction Component

CHAPTER 8

THE
TRACTION COMPONENT

FROM LUFTMENSCH TO ACTION!

Action is the process of
doing. That's what this chapter is all
about. Gaining traction means making your
vision a reality. At this moment, your vision is
crystal clear, you have the right people in the right seats, you're
managing data, you're solving your issues, and you've defined your
*Way* of doing business and
everyone is following it. Now you're ready to master
organizational traction, the final piece of the puzzle.
Mastering the first five
components was essential before tackling this component, because without
them, you might gain traction, but in the wrong direction.
When the first five components are
strong, you will take off in the right direction---toward your
vision.

The ability to create accountability and discipline, and then execute,
is the area of greatest weakness in most organizations.
If I asked you to rate the level
of accountability in your organization on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10
being your perfect level of accountability, how would you rate it?
Successful leaders rate themselves
high because they know how to gain traction.
When meeting with the average new
client for the first time, though, they typically rate their current
accountability at 4.

This is a real shame, because the world is filled with many great
visions. Unfortunately, most will go
unrealized due to an inability to gain traction.
Visionaries like to stay on a high
plane, not at ground level. After more than 20 years of
observing failures, I realized how to bridge the gap between vision and
execution.

I recently learned a word that makes the point.
Luftmensch is a Yiddish word made
from two others; *luft* means "air" and mensch
means "person." A *luftmensch* is an "air-person,"
someone who has his or her head in the clouds.
I don't mean this as an insult.
Ideas come from having your head
in the clouds. Most visionaries would agree with
me. That is their gift, their
strength, and their value. Nothing exists without
visionaries. Yet once the vision is clear, you
need to go from *luftmensch* to
action.

Most leaders know that bringing discipline and accountability to the
organization will make people a little uncomfortable.
That's an inevitable part of
creating traction. What usually holds an organization
back is the fear of creating this discomfort.
But you don't have any other
option if you want to build a great company.
If you can accept the fact that
you're going to make people a little uncomfortable for a short time, the
solution is actually straightforward. You need to implement
two simple practices.

As with all the steps along the way, this one requires a total
commitment from the leadership team. There will be far too
many opportunities to pull back and retreat.
If your leadership can stay the
course, however, within months your people will appreciate the increased
accountability, improved communication, and solid results.
The discomfort you were concerned
about turns out to be not nearly as bad as you thought.
And truth be told, the people who
continue to resist are either the wrong people or in the wrong
seat.

This is one of the secrets to the EOS methodology: We don't let
leadership teams turn back. For that, they eventually thank us
and say they don't know how they could previously have lived without
this high level of traction, accountability, and
results.

What are the two disciplines needed to gain traction?
First, everyone must set specific,
measurable priorities. Second, you must meet better as an
organization. These two essentials are called:
Rocks and a Meeting Pulse.

Before we dig deeper into each of the disciplines, I offer some
before-and-after statements from clients that have fully implemented
these traction tools. You or your people may relate to
them.

BEFORE TRACTION

No Accountability

     • "I really didn't know who I was accountable
to."

     • "Although we agreed to meet on a regular basis, in actuality we
didn't. We lacked accountability and
focus."

     • "Before Rocks, there was no
clarity."

Poor Communication

     • "I felt alone in my understanding of what was needed in the
company. I also was
misunderstood."

     • "I've worked here for over 20 years, and before Rocks, I was
never in the loop."

Stagnation

     • "We were fairly disciplined about creating one-year goals, but
would frequently find ourselves at the end of the year having made no
substantive progress toward those goals. It was tough to stay
focused on them throughout the year."

     • "We had no clear direction or priority.
Everything was important, and as a
result our efforts were not directed where they were most effective.
'We suffered from the classic
'show up and work for work's sake.'"

     • "*Everything* was a
priority."

Chaos

     • "It was tough to get out of the day-to-day emergencies and focus
on the most important priorities."

     • "We didn't meet very often. Coming to a decision
could take weeks, and we always had to re-present the
information."

     • "Things slipped through the cracks."

     • "No structure, lack of communication around goals and issues.
Problems were not resolved, and
they just stacked up. We had no method to measure
results."

     • "We were very reactionary, dealing with the problem of the week
or month."

     • "It was not clear whose job was whose, so I always felt
everything was on my shoulders and I had to do it
all."

AFTER TRACTION

Accountability

     • "After Rocks, everyone on the team has responsibility, clarity,
and timing on what has to get done. Also, each team member
is clear on his or her accountability. Everyone is on the same
page."

     • "I see us now working more as a cohesive unit with purpose and
direction. We are working toward closure with
issues, employee accountability, and job responsibilities.
We now have some organization with
a focus on what we do best."

     • "With the Rocks and Meeting Pulse in place, I feel the ability
for me and my team to focus better on the big-picture items.
More is getting done in the same
amount of time, and we have a heightened sense of urgency to get things
done by certain due dates."

Communication

     • "The meetings are 90 minutes and no longer.
It's taking time, but I can now
see the benefits of having weekly meetings as opposed to
monthly."

     • "Now at least with the Rocks and weekly meetings, I get a sense
of priority, and I know what direction the company is
going."

     • "The Meeting Pulses have really served as an excellent
communication vehicle to cascade messages within our rapidly changing
environment."

Organization

     • "Rocks gave me a way to check in with my reports and drive
better results in a highly consistent
manner."

     • "Life after Rocks is very rewarding!
All players are on the same page.
We are focused toward a common
goal. There is clarity in both
expectations and direction. We can clearly identify weak
performers and those that do not fit within our organization.
Truly, it is like night and
day!"

     • "Rocks keep everyone focused, and allow us to work toward
one-year goals in bite-sized chunks. Rocks have become the
measurable and the lingo of our organization.
We see employees seriously
approaching their Rocks with a sense of pride and
commitment."

Traction

     • "Now I feel that the forward momentum is turbocharging our
organization by getting everyone to help row the
boat."

     • "With Rocks, we have found the way to achieve goals, hold people
accountable, and move in a positive direction on a continuous
basis."

     • "Now we are getting ahead of the problems and pushing into
prediction and working on our systems. We have more time to
work forward, not deal with past problems."

ROCKS

With a clear long-term vision in place, you're ready to establish
short-term priorities that contribute to achieving your vision.
You will establish the three to
seven most important priorities for the company, the ones that must be
done in the next 90 days. Those priorities are called
Rocks.

If you woke up tomorrow morning and listed every single detail and
action necessary for you to achieve your long-term vision, you would
probably have a list of at least 100 items, maybe 1,000.
It would be overwhelming,
debilitating, and downright impossible.

Now, imagine that you and your leadership team met this quarter and
completely agreed on the three to seven most important priorities that
the company must accomplish in the next 90 days to achieve your
long-term vision. You could wake up tomorrow morning
knowing that there are only three to seven critical objectives that must
be accomplished. You would be more focused and
effective and would feel less overwhelmed.

That's why you create a 90-Day World. Rather than be
overwhelmed by the monumental task of accomplishing your vision, this
allows you to break it down into bite-size chunks called
Rocks.

Your company will have Rocks, each member of your leadership team will
have Rocks, and your employees will also have Rocks.
The reason to limit Rocks to three
to seven (preferably closer to three) is that you're going to break the
organization of the habit of trying to focus on everything at once.
It simply can't be done.
By limiting priorities, you can
focus on what is most important. With the increased intensity of
focusing on a limited number of Rocks, your people will accomplish more.
Remember the old saying: When
everything is important, nothing is important.
The way you move the company
forward is one 90-day period at a time.

Rocks create a short-term focus similar to the point I raised earlier
from Al Ries's book *Focus*.
To the degree that you focus
everyone in one direction, you'll gain the power of that laser beam,
gaining traction toward your goals.

Once your vision is clear, you will set better Rocks.
Setting these priorities becomes
simple. Once you set the company Rocks and
then the leadership team's Rocks, you then communicate these Rocks to
the entire organization so they
can set theirs. This process creates alignment.
The exact process for establishing
Rocks as a team and then rolling out this process organization-wide will
be explained in this chapter.

By the way, it doesn't matter what you call these priorities; however,
most companies really like calling them Rocks.
I learned the term from Verne
Harnish, the author of *Mastering the Rockefeller
Habits*. Verne got it from an
analogy in Stephen Covey's book *First Things
First*. Picture a glass cylinder
set on a table. Next to the cylinder are rocks,
gravel, sand, and a glass of water. Imagine the glass
cylinder as all of the time you have in a day.
The rocks are your main
priorities, the gravel represents your day-to-day responsibilities, the
sand represents interruptions, and the water is everything else that you
get hit with during your workday. If you, as most people do, pour
the water in first, the sand in second, the gravel in third, and the
rocks last, what happens? Those big priorities won't fit
inside the glass cylinder. That's your typical
day.

What happens if you do the reverse? Work on the big stuff
first: Put the rocks in. Next come the day-to-day
responsibilities: Add the gravel. Now dump in the sand, all those
interruptions. Finally, pour the water in.
Everything fits in the glass
cylinder perfectly; everything fits in your day perfectly.
The bottom line is that you need
to work on the biggest priorities---your Rocks---first.
Everything else will fall into
place.

Less is always better, and a few priorities are better than many.
Do less, accomplish more.
Most organizations start out the
year with a huge ball of priorities and get very little done by the end
of the year. By coming up with Rocks every
quarter, you create a 90-Day World.

The process works like this: Your team meets for a full day every 90
days. You review your vision, and then
determine what the Rocks are for the organization for the next 90-day
period to keep you on track for your vision.

ESTABLISHING YOUR ROCKS

STEP 1

After reviewing your V/TO and getting on the same page, your leadership
team lists everything on the whiteboard that has to be accomplished in
the next 90 days.
On average, you'll discover about
10 to 20 things that you'd like to close out, although one client came
up with 75.

STEP 2

With that list of 10 to 20 items in front of you, discuss, debate, and
determine the most important priorities for the company in the next 90
days. Make a decision on each one
whether to keep it, kill it, or combine it as a company Rock for the
quarter. You make as many passes at the
list as necessary until you're down to three to seven.
As a result, the right ones will
rise to the top.

STEP 3

Once you've narrowed your list, set the date that the Rocks are due.
This is typically by the end of
the quarter (i.e., March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31).
Now define each one by making sure
the objectives are clear. This is
vital.

A Rock is specific, measurable, and attainable.
For example: "Close three core
accounts" or "Hire a new controller." A Rock is not a to-do
that is open-ended or vague. "Start working on the Customer
Service Process" is not specific, measurable, and attainable, and is
therefore not a good Rock.

A Rock must be clear so that at the end of the quarter, there is no
ambiguity whether it was done or not. Here is an example of
four company Rocks that were set and
defined:

      *Company Rocks due by March
31*

      1. Close \$1 million in new
business

      2. Document delivery process and
train all

      3. Narrow CFO candidates to
two

      4. Implement new information systems
software

STEP 4

Assign who owns each Rock. This is vital for clear
accountability. Each of the three to seven company
Rocks must be owned by one and only one person on the leadership team.
When more than one person is
accountable for a Rock, no one is
accountable. The owner is the person who drives
the Rock to completion during the quarter by putting together a
timeline, calling meetings, and pushing people.
At the end of the quarter, the
owner is the one that everyone looks at to assure the Rock was
completed.

STEP 5

Once the company Rocks are set, the members of the leadership team each
set their own Rocks. They first carry forward any
company Rocks that they own to their individual list of Rocks and then
come up with their most important three to seven.
Some of the Rocks that were
discarded in Step 2 for the company can end up becoming individual Rocks
for leadership team members. Please remember---no more than
three to seven. Any Rock candidates left over on
the original list that did not get picked up can be carried forward to
the next quarter by putting them on the V/TO Issues
List.

STEP 6

When all that great work is done, you then create what is called the
Rock Sheet, which is just a landscaped piece of paper.
At the top are the organization's
Rocks, and below that are each of the leadership team's individuals
Rocks. This Rock Sheet is brought into
your weekly meetings to review your Rocks. It will help create
clear accountability and focus on what is the highest priority in the
organization. With that, a wall goes up, and no
one is allowed to throw anything else over it, whether it's a
genius-level new idea or a hand grenade. Once the priorities are
set for this quarter, *no new priorities can be
added*! If someone does try to
throw something else over, you get to throw it back because you all
agreed on the current Rocks as being the most important priorities for
this quarter. New ideas and thoughts that arise
during the quarter should be put on the V/TO Issues List for next
quarter. This approach will help you create
laser focus for your organization. The following is an
example of an effective Rock Sheet.

STEP 7

Share the company Rocks with the entire organization.
As you learned in the Vision
Component, the vision must be shared by all.
Every quarter you should meet with
the entire organization for your state-of-the-company meeting for no
more than 45 minutes to share successes, progress, and the V/TO and to
unveil the company Rocks for the quarter. Remember, people
sometimes have to hear something seven times before they really hear it
for the first time, and this is one of the ways they will ultimately
share the vision.

STEP 8

Have each department set their Rocks as a team.
Just as the leadership team sets
their Rocks, each department team follows the exact same process to set
theirs as
well. In the end, each employee will
have his or her own Rocks for the quarter. Please note that while
the company and leadership team members should have three to seven
Rocks, everyone else in the company should have one to
three.

ROCK TRAPS AND PITFALLS

Your organization needs to avoid certain problems when establishing and
carrying out its Rocks.

     • Garbage in, garbage
out. For every tool in the
Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS), you will get out what you put
in. If you set the wrong Rocks, you
will spend an entire quarter pointed in the wrong direction.
Make sure you spend the necessary
time setting the right ones. Do not rush the
process.

     • It takes two quarters to master
Rocks. You will not master the
process the first time around. Be patient, because true mastery
comes from experience. You need to learn from two
quarters with only your leadership team setting Rocks before you roll
out the Rocks process to everyone else. You will make some
mistakes and it's important you learn from those mistakes first so that
you can be a better teacher for your
people.

     • Commitment
fizzle. Make sure that when
rolling out Rocks, you're fully committed to them every quarter.
Some clients start off with a bang
and then don't commit to their quarterly routine.
As a result they stop sharing them
with everyone, and your people will end up feeling like the Rocks
process was just another flavor-of-the-month
idea.

     • Too many
Rocks. Don't give people
outside of the leadership team more than three Rocks.
The responsibility is too
overwhelming for most employees to handle, and you would be violating
the golden rule that less is more.

Image One's Rob Dube explains the cumulative power of all those Rocks:
"One year during our annual all-company meeting, I had an idea to go
around the room and ask every team member to tell us a few of the Rocks
they accomplished during the year. While each person was
talking, I was writing the Rock on the whiteboard.
By the end, I was off the
whiteboard and onto many pieces of paper from the flip chart!
When you have a team of 35 people
like we do, take that number and multiply it by two Rocks per person for
a quarter, you get 70. Then multiply that by the number
of quarters in a year, and you get 280! That is the magic
number---we took 280 steps in the right direction over the past 12
months. Amazing!"

MEETING PULSE

For now and forever, let's dispel the myth that all meetings are bad,
that meetings are a waste of time, and that there are already too many
of them. The fact is that well-run meetings
are the moment of truth for accountability.
To gain traction, you'll probably
need to meet even more than you presently
do.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In Patrick Lencioni's book Death by Meeting, he opens the book by
making a humorous observation. After hearing many leaders
complain about meetings and saying things like, "If I didn't have to go
to meetings, I'd like my job a lot more," Lencioni asks us to imagine
hearing a surgeon saying to a nurse before surgery, "If I didn't have to
operate on people, I might actually like this job."
He then asks us to consider the
fact that, for those of us who lead and manage organizations, meetings
are pretty much what we do.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's possible to hold extremely productive meetings that actually save
time. In this chapter, you will combine
the 90-Day World with a powerful tool, the Level 10 Meeting.
Together, these will enable you to
have great meetings that increase communication, accountability, team
health, and results. As a result of meeting more and
following the Meeting Pulse, everyone will get more done.
The time you spend meeting will
actually free up time for moving forward.

The Meeting Pulse is your organization's heartbeat.
Rather than long, meandering
meetings, a Meeting Pulse with a specific agenda throughout your
departments will keep your organization healthy.
A Meeting Pulse operates just like
an EKG illustrating a spike. When people have to get something
done for a meeting, they wait until the last minute and usually finish
it---that's the spike. The more you can increase the
meeting interval, the more spikes you get, and then the more business
you'll finish. At first you'll resist these
regular meetings, but as soon as they become a habit, you'll embrace
them. You won't know how you could have
lived without them in the past. I have seen this happen with every
client. It's where the real magic
happens.

The Meeting Pulse consists of two types of meetings.
The first is quarterly and the
second is weekly. Let's take them one at a time,
starting with the quarterly.

THE 90-DAY WORLD

As a part of your vision, you created a three-year picture.
After that came a one-year plan
and now a 90-Day World, as illustrated by the model on the following
page. The 90-day idea stems from a
natural phenomenon---that human beings stumble, get off track, and lose
focus roughly every 90 days. To address this aspect of human
nature, you must implement a routine throughout the entire organization
that creates a 90-Day World.

I first discovered its effectiveness in my own organization.
After my first full-day meeting
with my leadership team, we all came out laser-focused on where we were
going as an organization and what we had to do.
Roles and responsibilities were
agreed upon. We were on the same page and fired
up. But 90 days later, for some
reason, we'd all started to wander off track.
I couldn't explain why, so we held
another meeting for a full day, pulling us all back together.
We had a
passionate,
intense, productive meeting and got back on track again.
Yet after another 90 days, I had
to hold another meeting because I did not even recognize my team.
"What happened to the people who
were participating in that intense meeting 90 days ago?"
I wondered.
We couldn't be further off the
same page. But just like clockwork, by the
end of the meeting, we were fired up and on the same page yet
again.

I soon realized it was a normal cycle. When I really thought
about the problem, I noticed it affected my Entrepreneurs' Organization
forum group, my friends, and my family. It seems to be human
nature. Of the 1300 full-day sessions I've
conducted, at least 900 have been quarterly sessions.
People whose focus was clear in
the prior quarterly session became unfocused by the following one.
I would see absolute agreement on
core issues the previous quarter and then total disagreement in the
current one. By the end of the session, though,
everyone would be back on track. In some situations, people didn't
even remember agreeing. Fortunately, I kept very good
notes and could prove that they did.

Realizing this cycle was normal, I changed my attitude.
First, I stopped getting
frustrated and accepted it. Second, I decided to put together
a great agenda for a powerful quarterly meeting every time.
Now all EOS clients follow this
exact same agenda in their quarterlies.

One last point: If you don't continue to align quarterly, your
organization will fragment to the point that you will get far off track,
you will start to lose great people, you will lose sight of your vision,
and you will end up right back where you started---in
chaos.

To repeat, 90 days is about as long as a human being can stay focused.
It's human nature, so stop
fighting it and solve the problem by following the Quarterly Meeting
Pulse, thereby creating a 90-Day World for your
company.

In addition, I strongly recommend that you hold your quarterly meetings
off-site. When you're at the office, there
will be too many distractions to pull you back into the business.
Being away provides a great
opportunity for the team to truly work *on* the
business.

THE EOS QUARTERLY MEETING PULSE

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Who: The leadership
team

    Where:
Off-site

    Duration: Eight
hours

    Frequency: Every 90
days

    Prework: Vision/Traction
Organizer complete

    (Everyone brings his or her issues and proposed priorities for the
coming quarter)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE QUARTERLY MEETING AGENDA

     • Segue

     • Review previous quarter

     • Review the V/TO

     • Establish next quarter's Rocks

     • Tackle key issues

     • Next steps

     • Conclude

Segue

This is the transition from a full 90 days of working hard in the
business to starting to work on the business.
Each person should share three
things: (1) best business and personal news in the last 90 days, (2)
what is working and not working in the organization, and (3)
expectations for the day. Not only will this elevate
everyone to working *on* the business, but it
will also help set the stage for the quarterly
meeting.

One person might say during his or her segue, "The best business news
is that we landed the ABC account. What I feel is working
is the new customer relationship management software.
What I feel is not working are our
delivery times, the customer service department, and our inventory
system. My expectation is to solve these
three things once and for all. Plus, I'd like us to be a
healthier leadership team." This, along with everyone's segue,
sets the tone for the meeting.

Review Previous Quarter

Review all of your numbers (quarterly revenue, profit, gross margin,
and any other relevant key numbers) and your Rocks (company and
leadership teams on the Rock Sheet) from the previous quarter to confirm
which ones were achieved and which were not.
I highly recommend simply stating
"done" or "not done" for each. This will give you a clear,
black-and-white picture of how you performed.
Don't get caught up in believing
you can complete 100 percent of your Rocks every quarter.
It's perfectionist thinking and
not realistic. You always want to strive for 80
percent completion or better---that's enough to be truly
great.

If you didn't complete 80% you need to understand why and learn from
it. Look at the Rocks you didn't
accomplish. Discuss why they weren't
completed. The two most common reasons for
not achieving a Rock are:

     • *You took too much on and
overshot*, which was poor prediction on
your part. In this case, your team will need
to become better at setting more realistic Rocks.
The first time most clients set
their Rocks, they almost always set them too
high.

     • *Someone dropped the
ball*. In other words, the Rock
was attainable, but the person in charge did not give it his or her all.
In this case, you have an
accountability issue, and you need to put it on the Issues List and
solve it. In the long run, you will reach a
point where every member of the leadership team always gives his or her
maximum effort when owning a Rock.

You have one of three options with incomplete
Rocks:

      1. Carry the Rock forward to the next
quarter.

      2. If the Rock is 95 percent
complete, completing the last 5 percent simply becomes an action item
for the To-Do List.

      3. Reassign the Rock to someone
else.

Review the V/TO

The sole intent of reviewing the V/TO every quarter is to refresh your
memory on the vision and to make sure that everyone is still on the same
page. Within that framework, you will
set much better Rocks for the next quarter.
When people are not on the same
page, discuss and debate until they are.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Taking the necessary time to review the V/TO and get back on the
same page in the quarterly meeting also leads to much better issue
solving later in the session due to everyone having absolute clarity on
the company's greater good.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In an open and honest environment, everyone must voice their opinions
if they don't understand, don't agree, or have a concern with any item
in the V/TO. If there is any confusion, you
must solve the issue at that moment until everyone is in concert.
A good V/TO review takes between
30 minutes and two hours, depending how much discussion is needed.
Make certain you conclude the V/TO
review by updating the eighth section, the Issues List.
Remove any issues that have been
solved and add any new ones. This will build your Issues List
for the day.

Establish Next Quarter's Rocks

With the stage set from your segue, clarity on your results from the
review of last quarter's Rocks, your vision clearly in mind after your
review of the V/TO, and your Issues List in front of you, you now follow
the Rock-setting process covered earlier in this
chapter.

List everything that must get done this quarter.
Decide to keep, kill, or combine
everything on the list, boiling them down to the right three to seven
Rocks for the company and assign ownership.
From there, establish each
leadership team member's Rocks and give them to one member to create the
Rock Sheet.

Tackle Key Issues

With your Rocks set, you will have anywhere from one to four hours left
in your meeting, depending on how long your V/TO review and Rock-setting
took. It's now time to tackle all of
your relevant issues for the quarter. What makes for great
meetings is solving issues. Start by making sure that all of
the issues are on the list. Ask the team for any issues they
have on their minds if they haven't shared them already during the first
half of the meeting.

You now go to the Issues List you have compiled, which includes issues
from the first half of the meeting and all carryover issues from
previous meetings that were listed on the V/TO Issues List.
Remove all issues that were
resolved by the creation of new Rocks.

Tackle the remaining issues following the Issues Solving
Track---Identify, Discuss, and Solve (IDS).
Establish the top three issues,
then start with number one and work through the list in order of
priority. For each issue, identify the real
problem, then openly discuss all aspects of it, getting all opinions out
on the table with no tangents. From there, move to solve the
issue and make it go away forever. You will get through
anywhere from one to 15 issues depending on the time you have and the
magnitude of the issues.

Any issues you do not solve can simply be carried forward to your
weekly Issues List or the V/TO Issues List, depending on their priority
level. You will rarely solve them all.
The important thing is to make
sure you're solving them in order of
priority.

Next Steps

This part of the quarterly meeting is typically short.
Everyone discusses any next
steps---who is doing what, and whether there are any messages to
communicate to the organization based on the decisions made in the
meeting.

For instance, if you solved the issue mentioned in the segue regarding
the customer service department, in Next Steps you might confirm that
the director of operations is going to meet with everyone in customer
service and together strategize and implement a plan this quarter to
create a world-class customer service
department.

Conclude

In concluding the meeting, everyone shares three things: (1) feedback
on the meeting, (2) whether their expectations were met or not, and (3)
their rating on the meeting from 1 to 10. You want the standard to
average above 8.

It's powerful how much the Quarterly Meeting Pulse can do for you.
It focuses everyone on which
direction you should row. You come out fired up and ready to
take on the next quarter.

However, like clockwork, you're going to start getting off track again
90 days later. Some quarters, you may think that
you don't need to meet. I can remember several times
needing to convince my partners after they asked, "Why are we meeting
again? Aren't things going pretty well?"
Don't fall into this trap.
You have to combat the human
tendency to want to coast for a while and take a little pressure off.
I have clients that call once in a
while prior to a quarterly, saying they don't think they need to meet.
After I convince them they do, in
every case they have reported they were glad they did.
I can't tell you how many times
I've heard the words "Wow, and I didn't think we'd have anything to talk
about this quarter!" at the end of a client quarterly
session.

You're going to repeat that same Quarterly Meeting Pulse forever.
You will find that the meetings
keep getting better. With that routine in place, at the
end of every year you will piggyback an extra day on the front end of
your quarterly meeting for your annual planning.
Annual Planning is an opportunity
to build team health, reset the vision, and create a clear plan for the
next year.

THE EOS ANNUAL MEETING PULSE

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Who: The leadership
team

    Where:
Off-site

    Duration: Two
days

    Frequency: Every
year

    Prework: Bring completed
Vision/Traction Organizer, proposed budget for next year, and thoughts
on goals for next year.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE ANNUAL PLANNING AGENDA: DAY ONE

     • Segue

     • Review previous year

     • Team health building

     • SWOT/Issues List

     • V/TO (through one-year plan)

Segue

Each member of the leadership team shares three things: (1) the
organization's three greatest accomplishments in the previous year, (2)
his or her one greatest personal accomplishment for the year, and (3)
his or her expectations for the two-day annual planning
session.

The power of the annual segue, in addition to setting the stage and
transitioning from working *in* the business to
*on* the business, is that
leaders have a chance to stop for a few minutes and reflect on the
company's successes and progress over the previous year.
After the segue, one client said,
"I was actually feeling like we had a bad year until I listened to
everyone share the business accomplishments.
We actually had a pretty good
year." This is typically the mindset
after the segue, and that sets the tone for what
follows.

Review Previous Year

Review the previous year's goals, the previous year's numbers (previous
year's revenue, profit, gross margin, and other relevant key numbers),
and last quarter's Rocks. You should be achieving 80 percent
or better of your goals to truly be great. One of the ways you and
your team will become better predictors of future events is by reviewing
your results and addressing what worked and what
didn't.

When you review your goals for the year, you must take the same
approach as the Rock review. You want only black-or-white
"done" or "not done" answers. This is one reason your goals must
be very specific. If one of the goals for the year
was "create a sales-focused organization," how can you determine if that
was done or not? If the sales goal was "\$2 million
in new sales from the sales team and \$300,000 from account managers,"
you can definitely determine if that was
done.

Keep in mind your goals were set a year ago.
Most people's memories aren't good
enough to remember what the intention was that far back.
You don't have to remember
intentions if you have specific and measurable
goals.

There's another reason to prefer specificity.
You're trying to assess how you
did in order to determine exactly your degree of success or failure so
that you can get better at it next time. When the results are
vague and debatable, it's far too difficult to see clearly what worked
and what didn't. You then rationalize your way into
believing the year was better than it was. When you have no real
way to pinpoint what to improve upon, you aren't going to get better.
So even if your first attempts to
establish goals prove to be off the mark---sometimes way off the
mark---keep trying. With practice, you'll learn to set
targets that are truly specific, measurable, and attainable, which will
make you great predictors and ultimately lead to a solid, well-run, and
enduring organization.

Team Health Building

Many great team-building exercises are available.
You may already have one.
If you don't, I highly recommend
an exercise I call One Thing. Each member of the team receives
feedback from the others on his or her single greatest strength or most
admirable ability and his or her biggest weakness or hindrance to the
success of the company. The exercise is done out in the
open, with the entire
leadership team present. I believe the peer-evaluation
methods that are conducted anonymously actually do more harm than good.
This exercise has been done
countless times with teams, and it always has produced great long-term
results. Some clients have performed this
exercise four years running at their Annual Planning Session, and the
results get better every time.

After everyone has received the feedback from their team members, each
then must choose one thing he or she will commit to doing differently in
the coming year based on the feedback. It's short, simple, very
powerful, and effective, and it leads to great insights with improved
openness and honesty on the team. This exercise should
take no longer than two hours.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A great discipline I've used with my clients to assure full
delivery to their commitments is to do a quick feedback exercise in each
quarterly session. Each person states their
commitment, and every member gives one-word feedback on how they are
doing honoring it. They state either "better,"
"worse," or "same." It's a nice tap on the shoulder,
and it substantially improves
follow-through.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

SWOT/Issues List

Provide an opportunity for everyone to share what they believe the
organization's *strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities*, and
*threats* are.
This is the classic SWOT analysis,
a management tool for helping an organization take a good look at itself
and clarify its current state, both good and bad.
The most productive outcome of the
SWOT analysis is the Issues List. Once you have listed
everyone's opinions of the organization's strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats, you extract all of the relevant issues for
the coming year and create an Issues List for the Two-Day Planning
Session. This list, along with all
additional issues added throughout the session, should be added to your
Issues List for the next day's Issues
Solving.

V/TO (Through One-Year Plan)

At this point in the session, you challenge the company vision.
This is the Annual Meeting Pulse,
and nothing is sacred. Working your way through the V/TO,
take a hard look at your core values, challenge the core focus, make
sure everyone is still on board for the 10-year target, and confirm that
the marketing strategy
is still unique and valuable to the customer.
Where you're not on the same page,
discuss and debate until everyone is in
sync.

Assuming you're all in agreement, you throw out the old Three-Year
Picture and create a brand-new one. You want to make sure
that everyone agrees on the same image three years from now.
Once everyone's mind's eye can see
it, the odds are greater that you will achieve
it.

Once the new Three-Year Picture is clear, go to work on next year's
plan. Set the revenue, profit, and
numbers for the coming year and then set your three to seven most
important goals. Remember, less is more, so be
careful. One-year planning rarely takes
more than two hours. Don't overthink it.
When the vision is clear, the
numbers and goals are right in front of you.
You just have to put them down on
paper and agree with them. In addition, make sure a budget
exists to support the plan and that everyone is clear on their roles and
responsibilities in the coming year. Let the Accountability
Chart be your guide.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Some clients wrestle with the approach of throwing out the old
three-year picture and starting with a new one.
It's important to take this
approach for two reasons. One is that a full year has gone
by and things have changed, so it's important to take all of your
knowledge and experience and incorporate it into a newly created vision.
The second reason is that you're
smarter, better, faster planners than you were a year ago, and as a
result, you'll do much better work.

        If it's important to you to hang onto the old three-year
picture, I'd recommend that you cut and paste it into a document to hang
onto personally and see how you did, but the above approach is what is
recommended and most effective.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE ANNUAL PLANNING AGENDA: DAY TWO

     • Establish next quarter's Rocks

     • Tackle key issues

     • Next steps

     • Conclude

Refer to the Quarterly Planning Agenda for details on the above agenda
items.

Annual Planning Tips

     • Many times, the one-year
planning portion of the V/TO carries over into Day
Two. Let it happen.
You should not rush the process.
You will have time on Day Two to
complete the agenda if necessary.

     • Have dinner together as a team
at the end of Day One. Seize the opportunity to
blow off steam after a day of intense thinking as well as to continue to
build team health.

     • Get away for annual
planning. You don't necessarily
have to travel across the country, but a hotel an hour or two away will
lead to a more productive meeting. When you're removed from
the office, you'll be able to turn the real world off for a full two
days.

THE BUILDUP

By religiously implementing the Quarterly and Annual Meeting Pulse, you
create a 90-Day World that will reap tremendous benefits for your
organization. There is a hidden benefit as well,
one that I don't even share with my clients.
One of the main reasons that the
Quarterly Meeting Pulse is so effective is what I call the buildup.
With the prospect of a full day
scheduled for the leadership team to meet, people prepare better for it
without even knowing they are doing it. Their energy, fears,
thoughts, issues, ideas, and excitement all start to build toward this
special event. As a result, the meeting is much
more effective.

The opposite also holds true. That is, if you don't tell anyone
you are having a quarterly meeting and simply call them into a full-day
meeting, the result will be less fruitful. There is no buildup.
You must always pre-schedule your
quarterly meetings.

Many issues come up in the quarterly meetings that don't typically come
up in the course of day-to-day business. Countless times, when a
touchy subject comes up in the quarterly meeting that has been
lingering, others will ask, "Why did you wait until today to bring it
up?" Often they don't know why.
It's because of the buildup.
It has spurred thoughts beyond the
routine. People are more focused,
energetic, and ready.

THE WEEKLY MEETING PULSE

The traction process continues taking the vision down to the ground.
We are now narrowing in from
quarterly to weekly. Implementing this step will really
create traction and help you execute the vision.
Once the quarterly priorities are
set, you must meet on a weekly basis to stay focused, solve issues, and
communicate. As you can see by the following
model, the Weekly Meeting Pulse is your opportunity to make sure that
everything is on track. If you're on track for the week,
then you're on track for the quarter, and if you're on track for the
quarter, then you're on track for the year, and so on.
The Meeting Pulse, like a
heartbeat, creates a consistent flow that keeps the company healthy.
Put another way, the Meeting Pulse
creates a consistent cadence that keeps the organization in
step.

ALWAYS A LEVEL 10 MEETING

How would you rate your meetings on a scale from 1 to 10?
The response is almost always
somewhere between a 4 and a 5. That is simply not good enough.
Most meetings in business are weak
and not very productive, and yours probably are too.
By implementing the ingredients of
the Level 10 Meeting, you will raise that rating up to a
10.

The Level 10 Meeting Agenda is designed to keep your leadership team
focused on what's most important on a weekly basis.
Nothing is more important than
keeping your numbers on track, your Rocks on track, and your customers
and employees happy. The Level 10 Meeting is the most
effective and efficient way to accomplish
that.

A weekly Level 10 Meeting keeps you focused on what's important, helps
you spot developing problems, and then drives you to solve them.
What makes for great meetings is
solving problems. Patrick Lencioni says it best:
"Your meetings should be passionate, intense, exhausting, and never
boring."

The Level 10 Meeting was developed as a result of being engaged by a
number of clients to improve their meetings.
The guiding principles are based
on human nature. This agenda was developed through
real-world trial and error and experimentation with many different
methodologies. Today, all EOS clients follow this
exact agenda.

THE EOS WEEKLY MEETING PULSE

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Who: The leadership
team

    Where: The office conference
room

    Duration: 90
minutes

    Frequency: Every
Week

    Prework: Rocks established and
Rock Sheet created; Scorecard complete; Issues Solving Track understood
by everyone

------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE LEVEL 10 WEEKLY MEETING AGENDA

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Segue 5 minutes
 Scorecard 5 minutes
 Rock review 5 minutes
 Customer/employee headlines 5 minutes
 To-Do List 5 minutes
 IDS 60 minutes
 Conclude 5 minutes
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two roles are vital in the Level 10 Meeting.
One person must run the meeting.
This person will move the team
through the agenda and keep them on track. Second, someone must
manage the agenda. This person makes sure that the
agenda, Scorecard, and Rock Sheet are updated and in front of everyone
in each meeting. They update the To-Do and Issues
Lists in the agenda each week.

Segue

The meeting starts promptly. Football coach Vince Lombardi was
famous for his mantra that early is on time, and on time is late.
Arrive a few minutes early so you
can start to get your head in the game. The only reasons for
missing the weekly Level 10 Meeting are vacation or death.
Even if someone cannot make the
meeting, the show must go on. Don't reschedule it and don't
cancel it.

Everyone should have a copy of the agenda placed in front of them.
Your to-dos and your IDS Issues
List should be included in the actual printed agenda.
Your agenda should fit on one
sheet so that you're only managing one piece of paper.
You no longer need to take meeting
minutes. They should be a thing of the
past. If you want to know what was
covered in a meeting, check that week's
agenda.

As a team, you share good news to segue into the meeting.
As always, you need to create the
transition from working in the business all week to working on the
business, disconnecting from day-to-day affairs.
It's important to turn off all
electronic devices so you can disconnect, take a deep breath, change
gears, and get to work. In addition, the segue reminds you
that you are all simply human beings in this world trying to create
something great. This item should take no more than
five minutes.

Scorecard

The Scorecard review is the leadership team's opportunity at a high
level to examine the five to 15 most important numbers in the
organization and to make sure they are on track for the goal.
Any numbers that are not on track
are
dropped to the IDS portion of the meeting, which is your Issues List.
Avoid any discussion here.
The reporting phase should merely
identify problem areas. The biggest pitfall with most
teams is that they launch right into discussing and trying to solve an
issue. You must fight that urge and be
disciplined. That keeps the meeting on track.
There will be plenty of time to
discuss and solve issues in the IDS phase, and the process will be much
more productive when you're addressing all of the issues at once.
Scorecard review should take no
more than 5 minutes.

Rock Review

Next, your leadership team focuses on your Rocks to make sure that they
are on track. Review each Rock one at a
time---first the company Rocks and then each person's individual Rocks.
Each person reports that his or
her Rock is either "on track" or "off track."
No discussion---the discussion
will happen later. When a Rock is off track, it's
dropped to the IDS portion of the agenda. "On track" simply means
that the owner of the Rock feels he or she will accomplish it by the end
of the quarter. Even if a Rock is on track but
someone wants an update or has a concern, it should be dropped to IDS.
Rock review should take no more
than 5 minutes.

Customer/Employee Headlines

Share short and sweet headlines about any customer or employee news or
issues for the week, either good or bad. For example, "Joe, our
best client, is happy with the job we did last week," or "Darla is upset
with the decision on the new benefits program."
The good news is a time to pat
yourself on the back. Any issues, bad news, or concerns
should be dropped to the IDS portion of the agenda.
Some companies have a formal
customer and/or employee feedback system. If your organization
does, this is where you would incorporate that tool.
Headlines should take no more than
5 minutes.

To-Do List

Review all to-dos from last week's meeting.
To-dos are seven-day action items.
From a weekly review comes
accountability. By incorporating this agenda item,
you will accomplish more as a team. To distinguish a Rock
from a to-do, remember that a Rock is a 90-day priority while a to-do is
a seven-day action item. To-dos consist of the commitments
people make throughout the week that typically
don't get captured. For example, "I'll call the
printers tomorrow," "It will be shipped tonight," or "I will have every
prospect on the list contacted by Friday."

Quickly review each item on the To-Do List from a standpoint of "done"
or "not done." If the to-do is done, strike it
from the list. If it's not done, leave it on the
list. Note: An action item should not
remain on the To-Do List for more than two weeks, and 90 percent of them
should drop off every week.

The to-dos hold your team accountable to all the commitments they made
in the previous week. All human beings are
procrastinators by nature. Imagine what it would be like if
everyone in your organization did everything they said they would.
It would be a different world,
right? The power of the To-Do List is
uncanny. During the experimentation with
running a client's weekly meetings, I discovered that the commitments
that team members were making to each other from the previous week were
not being carried out. People would make promises, such
as making a call, shipping a package, or finishing a report.
A week later, I would find that,
of 10 commitments, only a few were done. As a result, I
incorporated a To-Do List into the meeting.
Once everyone had to report on
them the following week, the number of tasks completed went from a few
out of 10 to nine out of 10. Productivity increased because
people knew they were going to be held
accountable.

Traction and accountability are created when these weekly commitments
are captured on the To-Do List and are reviewed for completion the
following week. The days of making a commitment,
knowing that no one is going to confirm that it was done, quickly fade.
This agenda item should take less
than 5 minutes.

IDS

This is where the magic happens. It's time to tackle your
Issues List. Great meetings are created by
solving problems. You should have 60 minutes for
solving issues. This part should always take up
most of your meeting.

On average, about three to five issues on the list will come from last
week's meeting. During the reporting this week,
you will have added new issues---about five to 10, on average.
Typically, the list contains five
to 15 issues. Although your Issues List
is in
your agenda, it can be effective to write your Issues List on a
whiteboard or flip chart so it's in front of everyone.
Many clients have said that this
leads to better participation than everyone looking down at their copies
of the agenda.

Decide which issues are number one, two, and three.
Start with only the top three
because, as a rule of thumb, you don't know how many you'll resolve.
As long as you take them in order
of priority, you're attacking the right ones.
To repeat, it's a mistake to start
at the top of the list and work your way down because sometimes the most
important issue is near the bottom of the list.
In addition, when you solve the
most important issue, you tend to find out some of the other issues on
the Issues List were symptoms of that core issue, and they drop off
automatically.

Go to work on number one, and work on it alone until it's solved
following the Issues Solving Track. Some weeks, you will get
through only one issue. Other weeks, you will get through
10. You never know, but again, as long
as you're taking them in order of priority, you're tackling the
company's largest obstacles.

Once the issue has been identified, discussed, and solved, the solution
usually turns into a plan of attack that ends up on the To-Do List.
You may end up with one, two, or
three to-dos as a result of that one solution.
In next week's meeting, you will
confirm that the to-dos have been accomplished and the problem has been
solved forever, rather than hanging around as in the
past.

Following the Issues Solving Track keeps a team focused on what's
important, and it avoids spending time on what some may think is a
priority and really isn't. This vital portion of the meeting
should be passionate, intense, exhausting, and never boring.
There should be no politics; the
discussion should be open and honest, with everyone sharing the vision
and fighting for the greater good. By solving all of your
key issues for the week, you feel a tremendous sense of resolve and
accomplishment.

Conclude

With five minutes left, move to conclude the meeting.
This is your opportunity to pull
the whole meeting together. You can frame everything that was
discussed and make sure no loose ends are
left.

Concluding has two parts. First, recap your new To-Do List.
Quickly restate all of the action
items on the list to confirm that everyone has theirs written down.
This step reinforces
accountability. Second, discuss whether any
messages need to be communicated to the organization based on decisions
you made today, how you're going to communicate them, and what medium
you're going to use. This step will greatly reduce
communication issues that may have occurred in the past, when people
were surprised with changes that were made without their
knowledge.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I highly recommend adding a third item to your conclusion of the
meeting to help you get instant feedback on how you're doing.
Simply have everyone rate the
meeting at the end on a scale of 1 to 10. Your goal should be an 8
or better.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the end of the meeting, there should be a feeling of conclusion.
The meeting ends on time.
This avoids any domino effect
where meetings run over and push other appointments back, blowing up
people's schedules. And that is the Level 10 Meeting
Agenda in a nutshell.

THE FIVE POINTS OF THE WEEKLY MEETING
PULSE

A productive Meeting Pulse should meet the following five criteria.
The meetings
must

      1. be on the same day each
week,

      2. be at the same time each
week,

      3. have the same printed
agenda,

      4. start on time,
and

      5. end on
time.

Making the meeting the same day and time creates a routine.
Using the same agenda discourages
reinventing the wheel; once you have an agenda that works, stick to it.
Plus, it also helps to keep the
meetings consistent. Start on time, because when you
start the meeting late, the part of the meeting that always suffers is
the issues-solving time, and that's what matters most in the meeting.
You will cut down the best part.
And end on time so that you don't
push back any following meetings.

Be patient with the Weekly Meeting Pulse. Your first meeting will
be awkward, but as you stay committed to it, it will become very
comfortable. The level of team health,
communication, and results will consistently
rise.

THE WEEKLY MEETING ROLLOUT

Once you master the Weekly Meeting Pulse as a leadership team, the next
step is to roll it out to each department. Clients typically take
about three months to institute the Weekly Meeting Pulse throughout
their organization, because the leadership team must master it first.
Departmental weekly meetings are
typically closer to 30 to 60 minutes. Use the Level 10 Meeting
Agenda as a guide for customizing your departmental meeting agendas.
Just make sure that at least 50
percent of the meeting time is spent solving
issues.

MEETING PULSE ACTIONS

      1. Schedule your quarterly session
as close to the quarter's end as possible and then every quarter after
that. Follow the agenda and
Rock-setting process in your quarterly meetings, then roll Rocks out by
department.

      2. Decide when your Weekly Meeting
Pulse will be as a leadership team.
Pick the ideal day and time for
you to meet every week. There is no rule of thumb; just
decide what works best for you.

      3. Follow the Level 10 Meeting to
the letter for one month. At the end of the month,
read this chapter again. Make any fine-tuning adjustments,
and then continue for another month. If in the future you
find yourself getting off track again, refer back to the chapter as
often as necessary to stay focused.

      4. Decide who is going to run the
meeting. There can only be one.
This person has to be comfortable
moving people along and pushing them through the agenda when they are
getting off track.

      5. Decide who is going to manage
the agenda. This person keeps the
To-Do and Issues Lists updated during the meeting and makes sure a copy
of the agenda, the Rock Sheet, and the Scorecard are placed in front of
everyone when the meeting starts every
week.

By setting Rocks and implementing a Meeting Pulse that creates a 90-Day
World and weekly focus, you gain tremendous traction toward your
vision.

You are now doing what the successful companies do.
Your frustrations from the past
start to subside, and you make progress on your way to breaking through
the ceiling. Your organization evolves from
chaotic to a well-oiled machine. Your journey is now complete.
Or has it just
started?
