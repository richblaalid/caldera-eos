# Chapter 9: Pulling It All Together

CHAPTER 9

PULLING IT
ALL TOGETHER

THE GRAND JOURNEY

Now that the context is
clear, mastery of all Six Key Components is within reach.
You're well on your way to
achieving 100 percent. Mastery means that you and your
leadership team understand each tool and have implemented them
properly.

Many books have been written on the topics of meetings, planning,
solving problems, developing people, and prioritizing.
What is new about the
Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) is the way these disciplines have
been assembled into a complete system for running an entrepreneurial
organization. Each individual tool is not as
important as the whole, and all six components that make up the
Entrepreneurial Operating System and The EOS Model need to be understood
and mastered in order to fully gain traction.

If, as many clients do, you want a visual of The EOS Model in front of
you to serve as a constant reminder of the Six Key Components, you can
download one free at [www.eosworldwide.com/model](http://www.eosworldwide.com/model).

The combination of strengthening the Vision, People, Data, Issues,
Process, and Traction Components is what makes the real magic occur.
This book started from the premise
that, whether consciously or unconsciously, successful entrepreneurs
have a habit of strengthening six components of their business, and to
the degree that you can do so yourself, you will build a great
organization. As a result, your frustrations
regarding control of your time and your business will diminish.
Frustrations about employees will
fall away because you will be surrounded by the right people in the
right seats. You will finally break through
the
ceiling you've been hitting, you will transform your everyday business,
and, ultimately, you will realize your organization's vision.
At this point, I hope that you now
see that premise is true.

As your leadership team works toward implementing these tools, you may
have trouble seeing progress. The results won't always show on
your P&L right away. In the early stages, you're also
going to dredge up a lot of issues that will feel a bit overwhelming.
Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Harvard
Business School professor and bestselling author of
*Confidence: How Winning and
Losing Streaks Begin and End*, once described what she refers
to as Kanter's law: "Everything can look like a failure in the middle."
Sometimes on your journey, you'll
feel like it's not working. When this occurs, I urge you to
stay the course. Mastery requires total commitment,
and gaining traction requires a complete operating
system.

Shifting your organization from chaos to strengthening the Six Key
Components was the journey to this point. It's now time to take a
little pressure off, because achieving 100 percent requires a state of
perfection that doesn't exist. Truth be told, if you can reach
even 80 percent, you will have a great company.
That's because the work of
managing an EOS company is never complete and never automatic.
Just like the task of keeping
anything else healthy, it takes nurturing, care, and a maintained
routine.

Anything you learn from now on regarding running and building a great
business will fit into this context, The EOS Model.
Your challenge will be deciding
which ones align with the greater good of your company and which ones
don't. Always let your core values, core
focus, and 10-year target be your guide.

I recommend that you and your leadership team fill out the
Organizational Checkup together at least twice a year to see how you're
progressing. This will give you a snapshot of
where you are on the journey between zero and 100 percent.
The goal is that you are always
making progress.

The real goal is 80 percent or better. If you're above that
level, you have a well-oiled machine with the traction you require.
The highest score ever achieved is
88 percent, by The Benefits Company, a 10-person organization that is
one of the best small companies I've ever seen.
Rob Tamblyn, the owner and a pure
visionary, had a vision to create the best service company in the
benefits business.

Since beginning The EOS Process, The Benefits Company has experienced
30 percent growth on average every year for the last five years.
To say that it's gaining traction
would be an understatement.

Filling out the Organizational Checkup at least twice every year shows
you how you're progressing as an organization.
Together with your leadership
team, you can find the gaps between where you are and where you want to
go. The gaps are issues that go on the
Issues List. You can then determine if they are
a high enough priority to tackle. If so, the solutions become goals,
Rocks, and to-dos for the coming year.

For example, say you rate yourselves a 3 out of 5 on the fifth
statement, "Our target market is clear, and our sales and marketing
efforts are focused on it." You might decide that a Rock for
this quarter is for the sales manager to redefine your target market,
clean up your sales pipeline, and train all salespeople on
it.

Another example might be that you rated yourselves a 4 out of 5 on the
first statement, "We have a clear vision in writing that has been
properly communicated and shared by everyone."
You realize the gap is that not
everyone shares the vision and you have not been sharing it often
enough. As a result you set a Rock for the
quarter to address several people who do not share the vision and to
make a decision on their future. In addition, someone has a to-do
to schedule a meeting with everyone to share the vision again and get
back on track with quarterly company
meetings.

ORGANIZATIONAL CHECKUP

For each statement below, rank your business on a scale of 1 to 5 where
1 is weak and 5 is strong.

One more example might be that you rated yourselves 2 out of 5 on
statement number 16: "Our systems and processes are documented,
simplified, and followed by all." Seeing this gap, you agree as a
team once and for all to make it a goal for this year to finally
document your core processes.

Filling out the Organizational Checkup at least twice every year will
clarify all gaps, put those issues into action, and ultimately enable
you to continue to climb toward 100 percent.
The goal is progress, not
perfection. You might feel frustrated because
you're not at 88 percent like the Benefits Company.
Yet success is not based on where
you are, but on how far you have come. If you were at 55
percent last year and at 63 percent this year, that's success.
The next year you'll be at 72
percent and maybe 80 percent in the year after that.
Keep using the principles, and
you'll break through.

DISCOVERIES, POTHOLES, AND DELAYS ON THE GRAND
JOURNEY

ROLLING OUT EOS TO YOUR COMPANY

Once your leadership team has mastered the tools in The EOS Process,
it's time to roll out the tools to the rest of the organization.
This is best done one tier at a
time. At first, introduce the tools only
to the people who report to the leadership team.
If you're a 10-person company,
that would cover everyone. But if you're a 250-person
company, you'll go through a couple of tiers before you get to everyone.
When rolling the tools out, I
recommend first choosing what are known as foundational tools.
These are as
follows:

     • The V/TO

     • The Accountability Chart

     • Rocks

     • The Meeting Pulse

     • The Scorecard

The other tools will follow in the order of priority that you establish
as a leadership team based on the organization's current state and
issues.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To help your employees completely understand EOS and the
foundational tools, have them read *What the Heck Is
EOS?* Written with my co-author, Tom
Bouwer, it is a complete guide for employees in companies running on
EOS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

YOU CAN ONLY MOVE AT YOUR OWN SPEED

Be patient with this process. I originally believed I could
advance every company through the process at the same speed.
In Month One, the Accountability
Chart would be completed. In Month Two, the perfect
leadership team would be in place. In Month Three, everyone
would have mastered Rocks and created a solid Meeting Pulse.
By the end of Month Six, all
processes would be documented. After many years, I have come to
realize that this goal is unrealistic. Each company moves
forward at its own pace. Forcing it to move any faster
could be damaging.

Two EOS clients from different ends of the spectrum make this point
clear. Without giving names, the first
client made two key leadership team changes in the first three months of
the process. That means he removed two key
people from the organization
and replaced them in 90 days. That is a blinding speed.
The second client took two and a
half years to make the first change on his team, and after four years,
he has yet to make the second. This is not a criticism.
If I pushed him any faster, it
would actually be detrimental. He must feel ready to make the
decision. In the meantime, the company is
still growing at about 8 percent per year.

The other determining factor of how fast you can move is the current
state of the company and the number of people in it.
It takes longer to turn a large
ship than a small one. A 200-person organization is going
to take longer to change than a 15-person organization.
If you have to turn over 50
percent of your people, the process will take longer than if you have to
turn over 10 percent.

McKinley is a textbook example of rollout. Keep in mind that
McKinley is a 700-person company, one of the largest real estate
investment and property management companies in the United States.
Upon completing our first few
sessions, the leadership team went to work on rolling out the
foundational tools (V/TO, Accountability Chart, Rocks, Meeting Pulse,
and Scorecard) one tier at a time. A full year passed
before the tools were understood and implemented by every person in the
organization. In Year Two, they documented,
simplified, and trained everyone in their core processes---their common
platform, as they called it. Year Three saw them rolling out a
measurable for everyone and educating each person on how he or she
contributes to the company's financial success, while tying compensation
to it. Each year CEO Albert Berriz
defined the right focus for the company and exercised discipline with
flawless consistency. Three years might seem like a long
time, but McKinley is a big ship. To see how far they have come in
three short years is remarkable. If your ship is smaller, you may
be able to make the transition faster.

One of the fastest companies to roll out the tools was Professional
Grounds Services. It's a 100-employee landscape and
snow-removal company that does large office and industrial projects.
It rolled out the foundational
tools in less than a year. In that time, Professional Grounds
Services shared its V/TO with everyone, implemented a new structure,
removed a key person from the leadership team, gave everyone a number,
and ensured its processes were being documented and followed.
Nowadays, the company tears
through issues with the best of them. It's a true case study
in efficient execution.

WHY IT WORKS

The reason EOS works in any kind of organization is that it's based on
human nature. The entire system is built around
how people really operate:

     • The 90-Day
World stems from the reality that
humans can only focus that long.

     • The To-Do
List in the weekly meeting is
designed to ensure accountability. When people know someone
is going to check up on what they committed to, they do
it.

     • The
V/TO is designed to get your vision
out of your head and into the heads of others using a simplified
approach of answering only eight questions.
This makes it easier for people to
see. When they can see it, they will
believe it and it's more likely to happen.

     • Data forces you to give
people numbers so you can measure achievement.
People relate to numbers because
measuring is a natural human tendency. It creates a benchmark.
If you create a culture in your
sales department of attending two prospect appointments a week, people
will strive to hit that mark. Setting measurable targets will
direct their activity.

     • Core
values go to the heart of human
nature. Like attracts like.
People who are like-minded work
well with each other. Different people have different
values, but when you meet someone who has yours, there is an instant
fit.

     • The Meeting
Pulse forces people to "keep the
circles connected," as Sam Cupp would say. People need to stay
connected. The saying "Out of sight, out of
mind" is true in any company. If you don't stay connected,
you're going to start to stray and people will start to work at
cross-purposes.

     • The Issues Solving
Track addresses the natural tendency
to avoid conflict, hoping that a problem will go away on its own.
It won't, and by giving people a
track to follow---IDS---they will solve it and feel better that they
did.

     • A single
system directs talent and energy in
one direction. It gets everyone speaking the same
language and playing by the same rules. You move forward more
quickly and everybody wins.

THE "CLICK\"

At some point in the process comes the big "aha" moment when everyone
gets it. Everything will "click" for your
leadership team. They will see all the pieces of
the puzzle come together and clearly understand how EOS is a complete
system and why it works. One client, a premier marketing
and communications company with clients such as General Motors, NBC
Universal, Master Lock, and Stanley, had the big "click" exactly one
year after starting the process. It was during the segue in a
quarterly session.

While discussing what was working, the leadership team shared things
such as, "Issues are being pushed down to the appropriate team and being
solved," "We are making decisions with our core focus in mind,"
"Everyone is focused on Rocks that align with the company goals," and "I
see how everyone being clear on and following the process is going to
lead to better communication, fewer mistakes, and happier clients."
That is the moment I live for.
It's the lightbulb turning on.
It will occur anywhere from the
first six months to 36 months. I never know when it will happen,
but when it does, the organization takes off from
there.

YOU HAVE TO DO THE WORK

Don't think that your company will get better simply because you've
read this book or attended an EOS session. You'll still need to do
the work. You'll need to manage your people,
talk to your clients, make tough decisions, and do all of the daily
blocking and tackling that goes on inside a business.
When Dan Israel of ASI realized
after a year into the process that he and his team were suffering from
neglecting the process, he shared this analogy: "It's like going to the
doctor and not taking the medicine, thinking that going to the doctor is
the cure." After Dan's realization, they
sprang into real, meaningful action, and are now generating three times
the profit as when they started the process.
That's not because of me, but
because they did the work.

STAY COMMITTED TO THE 90-DAY WORLD

Once you're on track, occasionally you or members of your leadership
team will doubt the need for the quarterly meeting.
Occasionally I have to explain to
a client why he or she needs to hold the quarterly meetings when
"everything is going well." At the end of the session, the
client always says, "We really needed that."
A quarterly meeting is essential
whether things are going well or not. You'll need to keep
everyone on the same page and make sure you're all on track for your
vision by reviewing how you did last quarter and setting next quarter's
Rocks. If you let a few quarters go by
without the meetings, you will end up right back where you started.
It's like taking your foot off of
the gas pedal; you're not going to come to a screeching halt.
You'll just coast until you
eventually come to a stop.

Another common excuse to avoid meetings is that you're all too busy or
that things are too chaotic. This is all the more reason to
meet. Don't worry about what hasn't been
accomplished. You must come together, assess
where you are, reset, and take on the next
quarter.

YOU WILL HIT THE CEILING AGAIN

As your numbers start to climb, you will actually feel a difference.
You'll start to gain traction and
move toward your vision. At some point, though, you will
hit another ceiling. When this happens, you have to
continue to practice the five leadership abilities.
You have
to:

      1. Simplify, using the EOS tools.
Remember that less is more.
When everything is important,
nothing is important.

      2. Delegate and elevate by knowing
when you and others are at capacity.

      3. Predict well, both for the long
term and short term, through your V/TO, Scorecard, and Rock setting and
by following the Issues Solving Track.

      4. Systemize by consistently managing
your core processes.

      5. Structure your organization the
right way using the Accountability Chart, which continually evolves as
you grow.

As a result of continuing to hone these five leadership abilities, you
will break through the ceiling every time you hit
it.

Niche Retail is a good example. When I started working with the
company four years ago, it hit its first ceiling at around \$4 million
in revenue. Last year, it hit the ceiling
again at \$12 million. Niche Retail had to make a few
changes to its structure and staff, which involved moving its entire
customer service department from Minneapolis to Michigan.
It also completely overhauled the
finance department and implemented a new IT system organization-wide.
As a result, it broke through
again and is on track for \$18 million in revenue this year.
Just like Niche Retail, you too
will grow until you hit another ceiling. If you're willing to
stay disciplined and continually focus on the Six Key Components, you
will break through the next one as well.

BIGGER ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER

As we said earlier, growth for growth's sake is normally a mistake.
Being a \$100-million company is
not all it's cracked up to be. In *Good to
Great*, Jim Collins alludes to the fact
that we will never know the greatest company in America because it may
be some \$10-million business in Middle America that doesn't want to be
known. You have to ask yourself this:
Would you rather have a \$10-million company with a 20 percent profit or
a \$100-million company with a 2 percent profit?
It's the same net profit, with
considerably more work at a higher complexity.
The answer should be a
no-brainer.

Don't get me wrong, though. There are great \$100-million
companies, even great \$100-billion companies, but they're the
exception, not the rule. Unless you have a really good
reason to go to \$100 million, why not become the best \$10-million
company there is?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    After hitting their next ceiling at around \$19 million and 70
people, Tyler Smith and his partner shocked their community (me
included) by deciding to shut down Niche
Retail.

       In a very real, open, and honest interview with Tyler, I learned
that the number one reason for his decision is that he felt he was no
longer living in his Unique Ability. He felt the company had
outgrown what he and his partner had wanted.
They had ridden a wave of ego,
hype, and excitement for nine years, and it had been a heck of a ride.
"We were like rock stars at trade
shows. It was intoxicating," Tyler says.
"We got addicted to the money and
the size." As he looks back, he remembers
that Niche was supposed to be a lifestyle company but had grown too fast
and they couldn't get out of their own way.

       Tyler loves technology, computers, and the Internet.
He found himself with 70 people at
the helm of the company, in an industry he didn't like and in a role he
didn't like. "I realized I no longer wanted to
be an integrator," he says. He felt unfulfilled and bored.
"To worsen matters, our industry
was under attack by competitors like Wal-Mart, Amazon, and overfunded
new companies. We also got hit with a recession;
it was a triple whammy. I don't know what we would have
done without the EOS tools on this ride. They're what held
everything together."

       Now, one year later, Tyler and his partner have started a new
company that he feels puts them 100 percent in their Unique Abilites.
Their company is called NicheNext
and partners with companies to optimize their web sales.
"I don't ever want to manage
another employee," Tyler says. "I'm happier and more energized,
and I'll make more money."

       The message is that building a great organization isn't for
everyone. Being an integrator isn't for
everyone. You have to know what you
want.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In his book *Small Giants: Companies That
Choose to Be Great Instead of Big*, Bo Burlingham illustrates the
value of staying small. He shares countless real-world
stories of companies that chose to stay small and private.
These companies shunned the chance
to go public or receive unlimited amounts of money to invest in growth
in order to protect and preserve what they'd built.
They define themselves by their
passion for their products and their commitment to their employees,
customers, and community---by embracing a clarity and loyalty to their
purpose.

COMPARTMENTALIZING

With EOS implemented, everything has its place.
In other words, every issue,
priority, action, or idea that is longer term than 90 days is listed on
your V/TO Issues List. Anything that must be accomplished
this year becomes a goal. If it needs to get done this
quarter and will take weeks or months to accomplish, it
becomes a
Rock. Any issues that arise during the
quarter and must be solved now go onto your weekly Level 10 leadership
meeting Issues List. Issues that are departmental in
nature get pushed down to the appropriate departmental meeting Issues
List, and any that are one- to two-week action items go on the To-Do
List in your Level 10 Meetings, creating a simple system for managing
all goals, Rocks, issues, and to-dos.

SAME-PAGE MEETINGS

When you have a partnership, it's crucial for the greater good of the
company, its culture, and people that the leadership is 100 percent on
the same page. This also applies to all
visionary/integrator relationships, even if they are not partnerships.
When you're not in sync, your
people will know it. As with parenting, the kids know
when their parents are not getting along, as much as they try to hide
it. The same goes with partners in
business. In these situations, I prescribe a
same-page meeting. Every month, you meet for a few
hours and reconnect the circles. You need to solve all of your
issues, share anything that is angering you, and express any concerns.
These meetings are not always
peaceful, but you will clear the air and resolve issues.
The objective of the meeting is to
communicate your thoughts, listen to the other's concerns, and solve all
issues before bringing them into the business.
You must also maintain a united
front in front of all employees.

Take the example of Todd Sachse and his partner, Rich Broder.
Early on in their process, I
prescribed the same-page meeting for them, and they loved it.
They have been holding same-page
meetings every month for almost four years now, and their company has
experienced explosive growth.

If you can't get on the same page, you might want to consider
counseling or coaching. This practice is not uncommon, and
mediation can be very effective. If you've tried everything and
feel there is no hope, it may be time to part ways, although this is
very rare. Generally, with counseling, you
can get back on the same page, and the relationship will become better
then ever.

I've had several clients end their partnerships after clarity of vision
and accountability and discipline were put in place.
Some partners just can't handle
what it
takes to build a strong company. If you're determined to go to the
next level, some won't be ready for the change involved.
Such a situation occurred with a
new client when the decision to part ways occurred prior to completing
three sessions. In the first session, it was
apparent that the partnership no longer worked.
The partners, who we'll call Jim
and Tim, wanted two totally different environments.
Jim wanted to keep the status quo,
and Tim wanted to leave its chaos behind and build a solid company.
In their second session, the
vision was clarified solely by Tim, because Jim wanted nothing to do
with it. Jim didn't even show up for the
third. They had sat down after the second
session and agreed to part ways.

The partners of a different company realized their diverging viewpoints
in the first session, struggled through the second session, and
cancelled the third session. They consulted their financial
people and split up their assets into two separate companies.
They now run their own companies
as sole proprietors.

Even more complicated was a new potential client in which the partners
were also brothers. When I entered the conference room
for the initial meeting, I found only one brother waiting for me.
He explained that after the
meeting I would have to meet with the other brother down the hall and go
through the exact same presentation. They wouldn't even sit
in the same room together. So I did both meetings, more out
of curiosity than anything else. As you can imagine, we never moved
forward and any advice fell on deaf ears.

Fortunately, these painful partner situations occur only about 5
percent of the time. If you're faced with one, follow
the same-page meeting process. If there is no hope, the answer is
clear. Think about the long-term view,
and you will see that by separating you will be better off in the long
run.

TAKE A CLARITY BREAK

Keeping your head clear, your confidence high, and your focus strong
are vital in maintaining forward momentum. Most leaders spend most
of their time overwhelmed, tired, and buried in the day-to-day routine,
unable to see beyond tomorrow. As a result, they don't solve
problems as well as they could, they don't lead their people as well as
they could, and they're not a good example for
them.

Great leaders have a habit of taking quiet thinking time.
That means escaping the office on
a regular basis for an hour or so. By working on yourself
and the business, you will rise above feeling frustrated and overwhelmed
to a clearheaded and confident state. As a result, when you
come back into the business, you will be laser-focused and in the right
leadership frame of mind.

You can do this wherever works best for you; it should never be in your
office. You have to go to a place where
your thoughts are uninterrupted. You can do this daily, weekly, or
monthly, whichever works best for you. Some clients have a
favorite place in the morning on the way to work.
Sam Cupp would do it 30 minutes in
his den every morning. I do it once a week for two hours
in a coffee shop. I knew a man that would take about
half a day every month at the library, and that did the trick for
him.

Such free time to think is vital. As Henry Ford said,
"Thinking is the hardest work there is, which is probably the reason why
so few engage in it." Take the opportunity to review
your V/TO, review your plans, read, think strategically, look at The EOS
Model, or fill out the Organizational Checkup.
What I recommend for someone that
doesn't know what to do is to sit with a blank legal pad and a pen.
I promise you, through this simple
exercise, all of the right thoughts will come to mind.
It's important that none of the
work you're doing is busy work. This is not an opportunity for
playing catch-up.

After taking a clarity break, you will come back into the business
clear, focused, and confident. You'll be ready for anything.
You'll solve problems better,
you'll be clearer with your people, and you'll set a better example.
When you're having trouble solving
a problem, check out for a clarity break. Take a deep breath, and
put the necessary time into thinking clearly through the
problem.

To start, pick a one-hour block of time next week, block it out, and do
it. If you wait around for the right
time to appear, it never will. It must be an appointment that you
schedule with yourself. Give it a try.
Just do one.
I have yet to have one person tell
me that it was a waste of time. You might be wondering where
you're going to find an hour. The amazing paradox is that the
hour you spend will save you more than that hour later due to the
clarity that it creates. You end up being much more
efficient and effective.

SHINY STUFF

When the business is really humming and on track, you may get a little
fidgety and start to get distracted by shiny stuff.
This mostly happens to
visionaries. Here are two discipline strategies
to keep you focused and engaged.

First, find a challenge inside the business.
Focus on your "acres of diamonds."
Put your energy into something
that is going to perpetuate the existing vision.
Dive into cultural projects that
will boost the core values and the people. Experiment with some new
products or services in line with the company's core focus.
Go interview your top clients and
really dig into what is working and what is not working for them.
Take employees to lunch and ask
them the same kind of questions. Test current products and
services, and make sure they are still relevant.
All of these activities will keep
you stimulated and further the vision of the
company.

Second, if you're starting to become distracted by shiny stuff that is
outside your core focus and your leadership is supportive, then go
explore. You must, however, protect your
existing business, making sure the integrator is comfortable with your
reduced time commitment. You cannot drain any necessary
resources or energy that the current company needs to achieve its
vision. If your new business idea is a
good one, and it doesn't fit in the current core focus, consider
starting a new company with its own resources.
Too many times, a new idea is
incorporated into the current company, and it's the kiss of death, due
to stretched resources such as people, cash, and time.
Even when both are great business
ideas, they are destined to fail when they do not have the resources
they need.

StarTrax¸ a social event company that provides entertainment for
parties and events, is a good example. Along the way, they
stumbled into corporate event planning, which demands a different
clientele, culture, and model. Nonetheless, they decided to
pursue it. After flat growth and struggling
to run two businesses in one over a three-year period, they realized it
was time to separate the two. The dual-headed company was
creating too much complexity and draining its resources.
They found an integrator to run
the social business, made him a partner, and then separated it.
They suddenly had two very focused
businesses with an integrator at the helm of each one.
StarTrax is now running well and
growing. The second company has been
renamed pulse220 and has grown 40 percent each of the last two
years.

If you're getting distracted by shiny stuff, choose one discipline and
stick with it.

THE ROAD TO HANA

Some time ago, a friend of mine and his wife visited a major Maui
tourist attraction called The Road to Hana.
It comprised a long and winding
road that, over the course of hours, took them through breathtaking
scenery, waterfalls, cliffs, mountains, and beaches.
At the end, there was nothing but
the small town of Hana, with one gas station.
When they finally arrived, my
friend's wife was very upset. She said, "We drove all of this
way for this?" She missed the point.
The Road to Hana is about the
journey, not the destination.

Don't make the same mistake with The EOS Process.
The journey of building a great
business is not about the destination at all.
Of course, you want it to be
highly profitable and generate wealth for yourself and others.
Yet, along the way, you need to
enjoy the lives that you'll touch. You need to get excited
about the value you'll create for customers, enjoy the pure pleasure of
playing the game of business, and be able to take pride in the
self-perpetuating system you've built. Once you have created a
business that doesn't require you to crank every single gear---an entity
all its own---you'll have more freedom for yourself.
The journey should be enjoyable.
If you're racing to get to the end
of the journey, you'll be sorely
disappointed.

By embracing this journey-focused approach, you're going against the
grain of what most believe is right. As a result, it's hard
to understand the truth. As Tal Ben-Shahar, PhD, states in
his book *Happier: Learn the Secrets to
Daily Joy and Lasting Fulfillment*, "Society rewards results, not
processes; arrivals, not journeys." The irony is that if
you're able to fight society's pull, you will then enjoy all of the
journey's rewards.

My closing on all my correspondence is "Stay focused."
If every person could just do
that, they would be happier and more successful.
We live in a world that inundates
us with information. There is so much shiny stuff that
it's hard to concentrate. If I could leave you with one
message, it's that: Stay focused. As for what to focus on,
that's your decision. It all starts with answering the
eight questions.
