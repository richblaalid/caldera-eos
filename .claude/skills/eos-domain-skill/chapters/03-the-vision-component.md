# Chapter 3: The Vision Component

CHAPTER 3

THE
VISION COMPONENT

DO THEY SEE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING?

A few years ago, my dad
made a humorous observation: People have a habit of firming up their
convictions in conversation by asking the question, "Do you see what I'm
saying?" On the surface, a question like
that doesn't really make any sense---you really can't see what someone
is *saying*.
Later it dawned on me that the
expression made all the sense in the world.

My dad is a visionary. He was my first mentor, and he
taught me how to lead, manage, communicate, and deal with people,
whether it be one or one thousand. He is one of only 140
Hall of Fame members of the National Speakers Association.
He also built the number one real
estate sales training company from the ground up and is a two-time
finalist for the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year
award.

As he well knows, most entrepreneurs can clearly see their vision.
Their problem is that they make
the mistake of thinking that everyone else in the organization sees it
too. In most cases, they don't, and as
a result, leaders end up frustrated, staff ends up confused, and great
visions are left unrealized.

The process of gaining traction starts here.
Clarify your vision and you will
make better decisions about people, processes, finances, strategies, and
customers.

Entrepreneurs must get their vision out of their heads and down onto
paper. From there, they must share it
with their organization so that everyone can see where the company is
going and determine if they want to go there with you.
By getting
everyone on the same page, you will find that problems get solved more
quickly. In *The Five Dysfunctions
of a Team*, Patrick Lencioni credits a
friend who built an organization from a start-up to a billion dollars in
revenue with the following observation: "If you could get all the people
in an organization rowing in the same direction, you could dominate any
industry, in any market, against any competition, at any
time."

A technology company that recently began The EOS Process came to me
after hitting the ceiling for two straight years.
The biggest problem was that the
leadership team couldn't put its finger on why.
There ended up being many reasons,
but the key factor was that the company had no central vision.
It was providing three very
different services to the market, and because people had to change hats
up to several times an hour to cater to different clients, the internal
operations were needlessly complex.

With EOS, the company made the decision to focus in one direction.
In two sessions, the leadership
team clearly defined their vision of who they really were, what they
really wanted to do, and where they really wanted to go.
In a very short time, they
simplified the organization and freed up resources by shedding two of
its services. This allowed people to focus and
excel in one area with one type of client. Now the company has
clear goals and a laser-focused marketing strategy.
Not surprisingly, it's once again
beginning to grow. As a result of these decisions, it
recently had its best first quarter ever, generating a 125 percent
increase in revenue over the previous year's first
quarter.

The first step is letting go because the vision you're about to clarify
can't be about you. It has to define something bigger.
You need to create a vision that
points the way to a greater good. The sooner you do that, the sooner
you will make better decisions that build an enduring company.
To learn how to create a strong
vision, you must first answer eight important
questions.

ANSWERING THE EIGHT QUESTIONS

Let's start by dispelling the myth that a company's vision has to be a
hundred pages long. You might need that level of
detail for financing, but rarely is it necessary to build a great
company. By simply answering eight
questions, you and your leadership team should be able to clearly state
your vision and ultimately enable everyone in the organization to "see"
where you want to go.

The first tool in EOS is the Vision/Traction Organizer (V/TO).
Not only is the V/TO designed to
get your vision out of your head and onto paper, it will help you answer
these eight questions. It's meant to help you create a
clear picture of where the company is going and how it will get there.
Most importantly, it does so
simply, by boiling your vision down to only two pages.
An example of a V/TO appears on
the next page, and an electronic version of the V/TO can be downloaded
free at [www.eosworldwide.com/vto](http://www.eosworldwide.com/vto).

I first learned the power of simplicity in planning from my previous
business partner, Ed Escobar. Along with my dad, Ed and I used
to co-own and run a real estate sales training company.
Once, Ed told me about the time
prior to my joining the organization, when he had presented a quite
lengthy business plan to my dad. After the first look, my dad said,
"Can you condense it to 10 pages?" A little frustrated, Ed
replied, "Sure." After some work he came back with
a 10-page business plan. My dad liked it, but wondered
aloud, "Could you condense it to two?" A little more perturbed,
Ed complied once again. After some more work, the two-page
business plan was created. When my dad's request to condense
it to one page proved impossible, the idea of a two-page business plan
was born. That simplistic business plan was
the catalyst for the creation of the #1 real estate sales training
company in North America. This led Ed to create a simplified
business planning tool known as the Life Business Management Plan.
It was the first tool I ever used
for business planning.

That notion was eventually helped along by Verne Harnish.
Author of
*Mastering the Rockefeller
Habits*, highly sought-after growth
guru, founder of the Young Entrepreneurs' Organization (now the
Entrepreneurs' Organization), and a regular contributor to
*Fortune Small
Business*, Harnish introduced me to his
One-Page Strategic Plan, an additional inspiration for the
V/TO.

In his book *The One Page Business
Plan*, Jim Horan also deflates several
popular myths, two of which are that "business plans must be long to be
good" and that they take "six months, a significant amount of the
owner's and key staff members' time, and expensive consultants" to
create. As Horan understood, neither of
these things is true. The simplified approach to
strategic planning is generally the best
approach.

What is vision? It's clearly defining who and what
your organization is, where it's going and how it's going to get there.
It should be simple to articulate
your vision, because it's probably already in your head.
Unfortunately, if there are five
people on your leadership team, there may be five different variations
of the company vision. The goal is to get you all on the
same page. To the degree everyone on the team
can answer the following eight questions and absolutely agree, you will
have a clear vision.

By answering the following eight questions and filling out the V/TO, we
will clarify exactly what your vision is. Let's get started.
The eight questions are as
follows:

      1. What are your core
values?

      2. What is your core
focus?

      3. What is your 10-year
target?

      4. What is your marketing
strategy?

      5. What is your three-year
picture?

      6. What is your one-year
plan?

      7. What are your quarterly
Rocks?

      8. What are your
issues?

Please note that it's recommended that you try to answer all eight
questions in a full one-or two-day off-site
session.

WHAT ARE YOUR CORE VALUES?

What are core values? They are a small set of vital and
timeless guiding principles for your company.
A good rule of thumb is to limit
them to somewhere between three and seven. As always, less is more.
These core values define your
culture and who you truly are as people. When they are clear,
you'll find they attract like-minded people to your organization.
You will also find that when they
are applied in your organization, they will weed out the people that
don't fit. Once they're defined, you must
hire, fire, review, reward, and recognize people based on these core
values. This is how to build a thriving
culture around them.

Unfortunately, most organizations have not defined their core values,
and the resultant lack of clarity hinders their growth.
When your people don't embrace
your core values, their actions hurt your cause more than help it.
By not defining what your values
are, you have no way of knowing who believes in them and who
doesn't.

When Image One started The EOS Process, the leadership team learned
early on that we would be spending a few hours determining Image One's
core values. Company co-owner Rob Dube argued
that they must solve issues first. "We prepared a list of
issues, and there are a ton," he said. "We should do this
core-value thing after we solve those." In reply, I asked him to
take a leap of faith and told him that if he didn't like the way our
core-value search was going after an hour, we could move on to the list
of issues. After the process was over, Rob
changed his tune. "I didn't just like the way it was
going, I loved it," he recalls. "I've been sold ever since.
I tell that story to all new Image
One team members and when I speak to groups about EOS.
Defining core values changed our
company, the way we do business, and the way we select our
people."

Much has already been written on the power of identifying core values
and instilling them in an organization. In the course of writing
*Built to
Last*, Jim Collins and Jerry I.
Porras spent six years researching
organizations that have endured through recessions and depressions for
decades. One of their key findings was that
in every case, these companies defined their core values in the very
early stages and built a culture of people around
them.

Despite that, the perceived value of core values has diminished as of
late. After all the hype in the 1990s,
they are now frequently regarded as clichéd and tired.
This, ironically, is what makes
them more vital than ever. In this book, they are the first
step to forming your vision.

One important thing to understand is that core values already exist
within your organization---they've just been lost in the day-to-day
chaos. Your task is merely a matter of
rediscovering what they are and instilling them as the rules you play
by.

The following is the exact process all EOS clients follow for
discovering their core values. First, schedule time with your
leadership team. I recommend a minimum of two
hours, preferably away from the office, as strategic thinking is always
best done off-premises. In that meeting, you proceed as
follows:

STEP 1

Have each member list three people who, if you could clone them, would
lead you to market domination. These three names should
preferably come from inside the organization.
Once each person has his or her
three, post all of the names on a whiteboard for everyone to
see.

STEP 2

Go over the names and list the characteristics that those people
embody. What are the qualities they
exemplify? What do they do that puts them on
the list? Start with a long list so that you
can see all the possibilities. To help your thought process, here
is a list of real-world core values:

     • Unequivocal excellence

     • Continually strives for perfection

     • Wins

     • Does the right thing

     • Compassion

     • Honesty and integrity

     • Hungry for achievement

     • Is enthusiastic, energetic, tenacious, and
competitive

     • Encourages individual ability and
creativity

     • Maintains accountability

     • Services the customer above all else

     • Works hard

     • Is never satisfied

     • Is interested in continuous
self-improvement

     • Helps first

     • Exhibits professionalism

     • Encourages individual initiative

     • Growth-oriented

     • Treats everyone with respect

     • Provides opportunity based on merit; no one is entitled to
anything

     • Has creativity, dreams, and
imagination

     • Has personal integrity

     • Isn't cynical

     • Exhibits modesty and humility alongside
confidence

     • Practices fanatical attention to consistency and
detail

     • Is committed

     • Understands the value of reputation

     • Is fun

     • Is fair

     • Encourages teamwork

STEP 3

Your organization's core values are somewhere in that long list you've
just created. Now, narrow it down.
In your first edit, circle which
ones are truly important, draw a line through the ones that are not, and
combine those that are similar. Remember, the rule of thumb is
between three and seven; after the first round, you should have the list
down to somewhere between five and 15.

STEP 4

Here is where you're going to make some tough decisions.
Through group discussion and
debate, decide which values really belong and are truly core.
Remember, your goal is to get your
list down to between three and seven.

Here are some examples of EOS clients' real-world core
values:

McKinley

     • Can do

     • Gumby™

     • Service

     • Results

Schechter Wealth Strategies

     • Clients' needs first---always

     • Collaboration

     • Enthusiastic, energetic, tenacious, and
hardworking

     • Honesty and integrity

     • Humility

     • Pride in work

     • Ability to adapt/adjust

Professional Grounds Services

     • We do whatever it takes in every
situation

     • We have fun

     • We are passionate about our work

     • We have integrity in all that we do

Don't run out and tell everyone immediately after you've established
your core values. Instead, let them simmer for 30
days and then meet one last time as a team to sign off once and for all
on the final list.

The next step in the process is to communicate these core values to the
rest of the organization. It's time to create your
presentation speech. People won't necessarily
understand what you mean if you merely state each core value.
That's why each one needs to be
backed up with stories, analogies, and creative illustrations to drive
home its importance.

When writing your core values speech, make sure you word each core
value with the same pattern or tense (e.g., "To always ..." or "We
always ..."). Make sure to bullet-point three to
five supporting examples under each. This will give you a
rough guide of how the speech should be laid out.
From there, you can
improvise.

Below is an example of an actual outline for a core values
speech.

Team-oriented approach

     • You can get what you want by helping others get what they want.
It's all about service.
How can we serve our customers and
fellow employees?

     • Strive to always act for the greater good of the organization,
not our self-interest.

     • We should view ourselves as playmakers---a good assist is often
more satisfying than getting the goal in sports and at
work.

     • In sports, team play overcomes raw talent if that talent is not
playing together. This applies equally in the work
environment.

     • We are a team and presently a very good one.
Let's together aspire and work to
become great!

Commitment to excellence

     • As the saying goes, "We only get one chance to make a first
impression." Let's make it a good
one.

     • The written word. It should be clear, concise, and
directly to the point. My dad is fond of saying, "If I
had more time, I would have written a shorter letter."
His point is this: Let every word
tell.

     • Use we vs. I. Using "we" signifies you
are a representative of an organization larger than yourself.
The use of "I" can connote
ego.

     • Be professional when the situation calls for it, and, likewise,
feel free to be casual in the right circumstances.
Use your emotional intelligence
here. However, when in doubt, err on the
side of professionalism and conservatism.

     • Reputation outweighs profit every
time.

Problem-solving approach

     • What do we do well? Solve
problems.

     • How do we solve problems well?

              • Get the facts

              • State the issues correctly and
succinctly

              • Ask the right questions

              • Engage in unrestricted but efficient
debate

              • Listen carefully to all
arguments

              • Based on relevant facts and persuasive argument decide
next course of action

              • Assign responsibility for "next
steps"

              • Promptly execute on agreed-upon course of
action

              • Follow up on progress at next
meeting

     • Sometimes a decision is made by not making a
decision.

     • Sometimes a "wrong decision" produces a better outcome than no
decision at all. Velocity of decision-making is
often as important as the quality of the decision.
Other times protracted
contemplation is warranted in order to get the right outcome.
This is an art, not a science.
Experience counts
here.

Candor

     • Open and honest communication should be our
goal.

     • We can all pursue improvement if we are constructively apprised
of our strengths and shortcomings.

     • Be clear and honest, yet sensitive and
supportive.

     • Avoid "talking down" to others.

     • Seek to communicate with proper balance of confidence and
humility.

     • When a decision is made that is not in line with your
recommendation, simply move on. Don't take it personally.
It does not reflect negatively on
the value of your input.

Fairness

     • Demand results.

     • Have a sense of equity. What is a just result under the
facts?

     • It's OK to be tough when circumstances call for it, but do not
take unfair advantage of your strength.

     • Be compassionate.

     • If you're dealing with a ruthless or unethical opponent, fight
hard but always within the rules of engagement.
Don't fall into the trap of
stooping to his or her level.

Balance

     • Work smart. Do what is necessary to get the
job done right.

     • Valuable output is the greatest measure, not hours put in.
Anyone can keep busy, but that
does not equate to productivity.

     • The story of the accountant who works until 11 p.m.
during tax season but has ample
time for golf/family in the off-season months---an example of life in
balance?

     • Volunteer in the community. Always seek to give
back. Involve your
family.

For more inspiration, here is a complete core value speech as it was
delivered to the 51 employees at Wolff Group by the co-owner, Stuart
Wolff:

      We at Wolff Group are about to embark on our 10-year anniversary!
One decade in business as Wolff
Group!

      But actually, nothing is more important than the number
51.

      Yes, 51. That's the number of individuals,
people---yes, you---that make up the Wolff Group team, the Wolff Group
family. Here are a few more numbers: We
could not have been in business for 10 years with four offices in three
states as one team if it were not for each and every one of you.
Each and every one of you adds
something to define who we as Wolff Group are.
We are one of the leaders in our
industry, yes, but we are so much more.

      Enough about numbers, let's use some words.
Words such
as:

          Integrity and honesty

          Hard work

          Service-oriented

          Dedicated

          Teamwork

      The words above describe us as Wolff Group.
These words describe what makes us
tick, what drives our passion, what is at our core, the heart of Wolff
Group, the heart of us. These words describe a part of
each and every one of you.

      Why do customers do business with Wolff Group---with a
Scott^\*^,
with a Tina, with a Bill, with a Lynn, with a Josh, with a Debbie, with
a Hank, with a Barb, with a Sean, with a Steve, with a Kelly, just to
name a few?

      Because these people I just mentioned and all of you understand
the importance of treating others with respect, and being honest,
sincere, and trustworthy. We know how important
...

      Integrity and
honesty are to a relationship, any
relationship, whether it be a business or personal one.
Tie that in with a sincere
interest in understanding the needs of our customers, listening to their
needs, and being ready to assist when needed.
To jump in and help out makes us
...

      Service-oriented.
This is why when a customer like
\ABC Company\ calls and tells Tina that the new product is on their
menu next week and the supplier is out of stock, Barb stops what she is
doing and adds onto the supplier's order to take care of the increased
demand for this product. And then again when we find out
that the supplier's order is on hold due to a credit issue and Debbie
has to stop what she is doing to help get that deduction cleared so the
order will ship on time. That shows that we are
...

      Dedicated and don't mind
Hard
Work. Then Sean gets an urgent
call from \XYZ Company\ on a Thursday afternoon saying, "We need you
in a sales meeting first thing tomorrow morning with \PDQ Company\."
So Sean calls Debbie in a panic to
help him out and put together a custom flyer for the next morning that
she completes and e-mails to Sean at 1:00 a.m.
that night.
That proves we thrive on
...

      Teamwork.
We respond with a yes, we can do
it for you, we can make it happen. This is a team of
service-oriented individuals that are focused on their customer needs,
work hard, and are ready to do whatever it takes!
I can go on sharing more and more
stories, but luckily for all of you, I will just name a
few.

      One thing you will notice about these words is that they're
virtues that we can't teach in a class or train you on; they are part of
what makes up each and every one of you. It's your core, these
are your core values, and it's what makes your heart go pitter-patter
every day. Whether it is in your upbringing
or in your genes, I am not really sure, but one thing is for sure:
People with these virtues are the ones we want to be a part of our team,
of our family. Continuing to be committed to
finding the right people will be one of the keys to taking Wolff Group
to the next level.

      Identifying what makes us tick is important, because it lays the
groundwork for who we are, where we are going, how we are going to get
there, and when. We are on a path that will take us
to places we have never been before, and things we have not achieved
before. We are on a path that will send us
and drive us to wherever we want to go. It is a very exciting
time at Wolff Group. I am so glad that each and every
one of you is a part of it.

      I am driven and dedicated to making the next 10 years at Wolff
Group the best ever. I hope you will all join me for
this ride---it's going to be fun! Here's to our next
decade of blazing a new trail!"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This core value speech was a tipping point for Stu Wolff to
catapult his company to four times its size.
He delivered this speech five
years ago, and since then, with clarity of his culture, he and his
partner decided to part ways due to a lack of core value fit.
He found a new partner with
matching core values.

        Once he built a strong culture and crystallized his business
model, he then acquired three companies that doubled the size of his
company and recently completed the acquisition of an equal-sized
company.

        Wolff Group is now a \$16-million company with a strong
culture---very well run and well respected in its
industry.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your core values should become a guiding force in your organization and
should be incorporated into your hiring process.
When you interview employee
candidates, they need to hear that speech. They need to know who
you are. It's easy to find people with the
right skill set, but you want the one that rows in your direction.
You will find that your hiring
success ratio will increase if you evaluate applicants' core values
before their skill. Every one of my clients follows
this exact same process. The reason?
It
works.

Once your speech is written, delivered, and incorporated into your
hiring process, it will become common language within your organization,
and that's where your core values will start to come to life.
There are many creative ways to
keep them alive. For example, one particular client
with an amazing culture names each of its conference rooms after a core
value. McKinley has a core value called
"Gumby." It gave each of its employees a
Gumby doll with an attached label explaining that Gumby is flexible,
helpful, optimistic, honest and pure, adventurous, fearless, loving, and
everybody's friend.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I've worked with many clients that have acquired other companies,
merged with other companies, and have been acquired (incidentally, five
of my clients have been acquired, and in every case, they sold for
unusually high multiples and the acquiring company said they were the
best-run small company they'd ever seen). The number one reason
those deals were successful and continue their success is due to core
value alignment. I advised every client to start
each due-diligence process with core value fit; if there's a fit,
everything flows. If not, I advise them not to move
forward.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In short, it doesn't matter *what* your core values are
as much as it does that you've clearly defined, communicated, and are
living them as an organization. Only then can you truly surround
yourself with the people who will prepare your organization for
growth.

Work on establishing your core values now.
Once you're finished, plug them
into the V/TO.

WHAT IS YOUR CORE FOCUS?

It doesn't take much for an organization to get off track in the hustle
and bustle of the business world. Businesses can easily
become distracted by opportunities that are wolves in sheep's clothing.
Others falsely assume that since
they are succeeding in one business, they can succeed in any.
Others simply get
bored.

Your job as a leadership team is to establish your organization's core
focus and not to let anything distract you from that.
Many things have the potential to
distract us from our core focus. Steve, a member of one leadership
team, calls it "shiny stuff." A competitor, a new idea, a new
product, and poor advice that looks like good advice at the time are
just a few examples.

The central concept of a core focus has been given many different names
over time, including "mission statement," "vision statement," "core
business," "sweet spot," "the zone," and "the ball" (as in "keep your
eye on the"). In his book
*The 8th
Habit*, Stephen Covey calls it "voice."
Dan Sullivan calls it Unique
Ability^®^.
And in
*Good to
Great*, Jim Collins calls it "the
hedgehog concept." I call it core focus because it
should come from your company's core and you must stay laser-focused on
it.

Russell H. Conwell's story "Acres of
Diamonds" illustrates this point well. To paraphrase: There was
once a man named Ali who owned a large farm with many orchards.
Ali was perfectly content with his
lot in life until one day, when a local priest
told him how the Almighty had created diamonds, and how one stone the
size of his thumb was worth enough to purchase an entire county.
As the story goes, Ali went to bed
a poor man. He sold his farm and set out to
seek a fortune in diamonds.

After years of searching all over Palestine and Europe and not finding
a single diamond, he ended up penniless. In a fit of despair, he
threw himself into the raging tide and drowned.
Soon afterward, the purchaser of
Ali's farm was visited by the same priest that told Ali about diamonds.
The priest noticed a small diamond
on the mantelpiece and asked, "Where did you find this?"
To which the man replied, "There's
a brook that runs through our farm, and it's full of
them."

Most people are sitting on their own diamond mines.
The surest ways to lose your
diamond mine are to get bored, become overambitious, or start thinking
that the grass is greener on the other side.
Find your core focus, stick to it,
and devote your time and resources to excelling at
it.

When business owners get bored, there is always the potential for them
to get distracted by the shiny stuff and inadvertently sabotage what
they've created. Fading passion and losing sight of
why you're in business are other pitfalls that could lead to the same
fate. Defining your core focus will
return you to your original levels of clarity and
excitement.

A great example of a company distracted by shiny things was Broder &
Sachse Real Estate Services Inc. Just prior to starting its EOS
process, the real estate management company had dodged a
bullet.

This particular bullet came in the form of a business proposal from a
man who wanted Broder & Sachse to buy an industrial building he owned so
he could start an engine powder-coating company.
The deal was that he would lease
the building from Broder & Sachse and would use the proceeds of the sale
to build the line and the facilities. The man had customers
already lined up; he just needed to build the company and open its
doors. On paper, it was a million-dollar
idea. Excited by the prospect, co-owners
Rich Broder and Todd Sachse decided to go one further and partner with
the man in the powder-coating business.

After investing a million dollars of their own money and a year and a
half of their time, Rich and Todd eventually closed the business.
In the three months it had been
open, it had lost a total of \$300,000. Clearly, it was the
worst business decision of their careers. There was, however, a
silver lining. Six months later, someone stepped
in and bought the company for almost as much as they had put into it.
They got lucky.
On the other hand, they still lost
a year and a half of time and focus on their core business, and that
loss is incalculable.

Their mistake is now known around the office as a CCT, which stands for
the short-lived company's name: Capital Coating Technologies, Inc.
Now, whenever they see something
shiny, they jokingly dub it a CCT and direct their energies
elsewhere.

Broder & Sachse's core focus is owning and managing real estate, not
powder coating. While a new idea may look like a
no-brainer on paper, it's simply not worth doing if it's not a part of
your core focus.

When your core focus is clear, you're going to come to several
important realizations. You'll realize that certain
practices, people, and, sometimes, entire divisions and/or product lines
don't fit into your core focus. As a direct result of this
discovery, past EOS clients have gotten rid of entire departments and
excelled as a result.

Once Image One, a \$7 million laser printer service and supply company,
was clear on its core focus, it eliminated its computer networking
business unit and focused entirely on simplifying its clients' printing
environments. The decision was a painful and
emotional one, but the company did it. As a result, it's grown
by an average of 30 percent for every year of the past four, resulting
in a sale to a publicly traded company in its industry for high
multiples.

Image One's president and co-owner, Rob Dube, says, "The decision to
close our computer division after six months was a turning point in our
company's history. Once our core focus was clear,
there was no turning back." Incidentally Rob and Joel have
purchased the business back and continue to grow it at 30 percent per
year. Image One was recently selected as
the Small Business of the Year by
*Crain's Detroit
Business* and also as a finalist for the
Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year
award.

Decide what business you are in, and be in that business.
As the old saying goes, "He who
chases two rabbits catches neither." Or as Al Ries pointed
out in *Focus*, "Imagine a medical
practice saying to itself: 'We are known as terrific brain surgeons, so
let's get into the heart, liver, lung, and limb
businesses.'"

I'm always amused when a client looks at another industry and says, "I
wish I were in that business. It's so much simpler."
I'll think to myself, "Oh, if they
only knew." In other words, I've yet to see a
single business that is easy to run. They
*all* take work.
Success in one kind of industry
doesn't necessarily dictate success in another.
You can only succeed in the kind
of business that is right for you and your team.
As Jim Collins puts it in his
bestseller *Good to
Great*, "You have to figure out what
you're genetically encoded to do." That's a vital point.
The combination of your talents
and passions combined with your leadership creates something unique that
no other company has, and that something is your core focus.
You must uncover what it is.
The following exercise was
designed to help you do just that.

HOW TO DETERMINE YOUR CORE FOCUS

First, you and your leadership team should define, with absolute
clarity, your two truths: your reason for being and your
niche.

Core focus is actually very simple. Don't overthink it.
After reading this section of this
book, lock your leadership team in a room for a minimum of two
uninterrupted hours. Start by asking them to write the
answers to the two questions below. Once everyone has
finished, go around the table and have them share what they've written.
Then, open up the discussion for
debate and talk as a group for as long as you need
to.

Do this with both questions, one at a time, until you're on the same
page and have each answer down to just a few words.
Be warned: You may need several
sessions to complete the task. Be patient and remember not to
overthink and overanalyze. Like core values, your core focus
already exists; it's just a matter of chiseling away the non-core items
before you can get it. What follows are the two questions
with some real-life examples and tools for
guidance:

1. Why does your organization
exist?
What is its purpose, cause, or passion?

When your purpose, cause, or passion is clear, you won't be able to
tell what business you're in. You should be able to take it into
any industry. This will also keep you from
confusing it with your niche.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    When entering your core focus into the electronic version of the
V/TO, please choose one of the three words "purpose," "passion," or
"cause"---the one that resonates best with your team---and delete the
others from the document. Less is
more.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When your purpose, cause, or passion is clear, it should meet all eight
points of the following checklist:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       1. It's stated in three to seven words.
       2. It's written in simple language.
       3. It's big and bold.
       4. It has an "aha" effect.
       5. It comes from the heart.
       6. It involves everyone.
       7. It's not about money.
       8. It's bigger than a goal.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Examples of purposes, causes, or passions*Cunningham/Limp: Customer
delight

McKinley: To enrich the quality of life
in our communities

Image One: To build a great company, with
great people & great results

Schechter Wealth Strategies: To create lifelong
relationships and raving fans

2. What is your organization's
niche?

Your niche should be simple. It will ultimately become a
filtering mechanism for your
team to make its decisions as you move forward.
Orville Redenbacher's theory says
it all: "Do one thing and do it better than
anyone."

*Examples of niches*Autumn Associates: Creating the right program with
right coverage for the right clients

Orville Redenbacher:
Popcorn

Atlas Oil Company: Moving
gallons

Image One: Simplifying companies' printing
environments

McKinley: Solving complex real estate
problems

With your niche and your organization's reason for being crystal clear,
you now have a core focus. Once your core focus is clear,
you'll need to stay true to it. If a new business opportunity
doesn't fit, don't do it. If someone on the leadership team
tries to throw something incongruent over the wall, throw it back.
Let it be your filtering mechanism
for all future decisions.

Below are some real-world examples of a company's core
focus:

Asphalt Specialists, Inc. (ASI)Passion:
Winning

Niche: Quality asphalt
paving

ZenaCompPassion: Creating efficient
solutions

Niche: Worry-free technology that
protects & grows our clients' business

Ronnisch Construction GroupPurpose: Exceeding peoples'
expectations

Niche: Meeting the schedule in all
facets of construction

Image OnePassion: Building a great company, with
great people and great results

Niche: Simplifying companies' printing
environments

Alongside two other partners, brothers Tyler and Jonathan B.
Smith founded a small technology
business designing high-end websites with back-end web applications.
Once they realized their current
business no longer fit their personal core focus, they left the business
to their partners and each went on to build successful businesses in
line with their core focus.

Jonathan went on to cofound Wave Dispersion Technologies, Inc., a
company that provides coastline security for countries all over the
world. His company made
*Inc.* magazine's list of the
500 fastest-growing private companies.

With his new partner, Brad, Tyler built the web retail company Niche
Retail, taking it from start-up to almost \$19 million in revenue, in
nine years. Tyler and Brad were finalists for
the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year award, and Niche Retail was
named #300 on *Inc.* magazine's list of the
500 fastest-growing private companies. Illuminate your core
focus, and you could generate those kinds of results as
well.

One important point: The task of clarifying your core focus assumes
that you already have a financial model that works.
If that's the case, it's just a
matter of focusing on and executing your vision so that the profit will
follow.

If you're a golfer, you know that the face of a golf club has a sweet
spot. While its actual size varies
depending on the club, let's assume it's about 50 percent of the face.
To the degree you hit the ball on
the sweet spot, the ball goes farther and straighter, contact feels
better, and you'll score better. The same applies to your business.
Just like a golf club, your
business has a sweet spot, and now that you have clarified your core
focus, you now know what it is. Assuming you stay in your sweet
spot, which might be about 50 percent of your market, your business will
go further and score better in terms of
profitability.

Once your core focus is clear, your people, processes, and systems can
be put in place to drive it with consistency.
Until you have exhausted every
opportunity in your core focus, don't allow yourself to get distracted
by the shiny stuff.

Now that the work is done, add your core focus to the
V/TO.

WHAT IS YOUR 10-YEAR TARGET?

Now that your core values and core focus are clear, the next question
is this: What is your 10-year target? Where do you want your
organization to be a decade from now?

One common thread unites successful people and successful companies.
All of them have a habit of
setting and achieving goals. That's why I am consistently
amazed by the number of entrepreneurs who can't tell me what their
number one goal is. To me, they're like rudderless
ships. How do you know if you're heading
in the right direction if you don't know which direction you're meant to
be going? As Yogi Berra said, "You've got to
be careful if you don't know where you are going, 'cause you might not
get there."

In their book *Built to
Last*, Jim Collins and Jerry I.
Porras found that organizations
that have endured for decades share another common practice: They all
set massive 10- to 25-year goals. Collins and Porras refer
to these as BHAGs---Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals---and define them as
having "a long-term vision so daring in its scope as to seem
impossible."

That's one of the main differences between a 10-year target and any
shorter ones you might set. This is the one larger-than-life
goal that everyone is working toward, the thing that gives everyone in
the organization a long-range direction. Once your 10-year target
is clear, you and your leadership team will start doing things
differently in the here and now so as to get you
there.

In *You^2^*, Price Pritchett
explains how to make such quantum leaps: "You must focus on ends, rather
than means." Your long-term target is that end
he is describing. He continues, "It is crucial to
have a crystal clear picture of what you want to accomplish ... Rivet
your attention on that spot where you are to land at the end of your
quantum leap ... Once you do that, it's almost as if you magnetize
yourself to the ways and means involved in the methodology for getting
there. Solutions begin to appear.
Answers come to
you."

The reason this particular target's time frame is 10 years is that 90
percent of EOS clients have selected it in the past.
Some preferred a five-year time
frame, while others went as high as 20 years.
The length is entirely up to
you.

*Examples of 10-year targets*ZenaComp: \$10 million in revenue with 15
percent net income

Autumn Associates: A referral from every client
and every client from a referral

McKinley: 20,000 multifamily units owned
and/or managed

Atlas Oil Company: 5 billion gallons
moved

Schechter Wealth Strategies: 15 percent of target
market

HOW TO SET A 10-YEAR TARGET

Meet with your leadership team and discuss where you want to take your
organization. A word of caution is in order
here: While your core values and core focus are already present within
your organization, the 10-year target will be different.
I've never seen a team land on the
same page with a 10-year target on the first go-around.
Be patient in your first
attempt.

I recommend starting off by asking everyone how far out they would like
to look. I would then ask everyone what
they believe the revenue size of the organization could be at that
point. This is a particularly fun
question, and you'll probably get a wide range of responses.
These different figures should
start to get everyone talking and ultimately in sync with each other.
Once those two questions have
primed the pump, ask everyone what they believe the target is.
It may take a few meetings to
settle on a final answer. I've had to come back to certain
EOS clients with the same question every quarter until they nailed
it.

Once that decision is made, confirm that everyone is motivated by it
and on the same page. As with all goal-setting
activities, your 10-year target must be specific and measurable so that
there can't be any gray areas. You will know the right goal when
you have it. It will be the one that creates
passion, excitement, and energy for every single person in the
organization whenever it's repeated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With many clients now closing in on or achieving their 10-year
targets, the question regarding what to do when you're getting close to
hitting it comes up often. The answer and rule of thumb is
that once you're three years from achieving your 10-year target, you
move it to your three-year picture (which will be covered on
page
66) and set a
brand-new one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add your 10-year target to the third section of the
V/TO.

WHAT IS YOUR MARKETING STRATEGY?

A mother, her young son, and their donkey are taking a long journey
through the countryside. The mother is riding the donkey
with the son walking alongside as they enter a village.
All of a sudden, the village
people gather and start stoning them. The pair run away and
manage to escape. The mother is dumbfounded, and as
they approach the next village, she thinks, "Maybe they thought it was
inappropriate to have the son walk," so they switch places and prepare
to enter. But once again, they're stoned by
the village people. At a total loss, she thinks,
"Maybe it's the donkey. Maybe they worship donkeys in this
country." So before entering the next
village, they decide to pick up the donkey and carry it, but it proves
so heavy that as they cross a bridge, the donkey falls over the side,
lands in the river, and drowns.

What's the moral of the story? If you try to please everyone,
you're going to lose your ass.

I can't tell you how many of my clients start out trying to be all
things to all people. They say, "Oh, you need that?
Yes, we do that," and, "You want
those? No problem."
Over time, though, they, their
customers, and their employees become frustrated, and the business
becomes less profitable. This helter-skelter method may
have gotten you to where you are today and helped you survive the early
drought, but to break through the ceiling, you have to create some
focus.

The intent of this section is to create a laser-sharp focus for your
sales and marketing efforts. Many companies waste thousands of
dollars on consultancy fees, inconsistent marketing messages, printing,
and time, all because they failed to establish a clear strategy from the
outset. A focused effort will enable you
to sell and close more of the right business.
It will become the foundation upon
which you create all future materials, plans, messages, and
advertising.

This enables you to be different and stand out to your ideal customer.
All of your people will have clear
direction on who your ideal customer is, what you're supposed to be
doing for them, and how you will do it. Ultimately, you will
know which customers you should and should not be doing business with.
That means you can stop trying to
be all things to all people.

In his book *Get Back in the Box: Innovation
from the Inside Out*, Douglas Rushkoff makes the
point that companies have to stop looking everywhere else for the
answers. Rather than hiring marketers and
consultants, he urges companies to draw on their own experience, core
values, and core competencies (core focus).
He urges readers to "stop solving
your problems from the outside in." He goes on to say, "Get
back in the box and do the thing you actually do best.
This disciplined commitment to
your own core passion---and not a consultant, ad campaign, or business
plan---is the source of true innovation."

Marketing strategy is made up of four elements, which are contained in
the fourth section of the V/TO:

      1. Your Target Market/"The
List"

      2. Your Three
Uniques

      3. Your Proven
Process

      4. Your
Guarantee

YOUR TARGET MARKET

The first element of marketing strategy is your target market, or "The
List."

Identifying your target market involves defining your ideal customers.
Who are they?
Where are they?
What are they?
You need to know their
demographic, geographic, and psychographic characteristics.
By identifying your target market,
you create a filter. Out of that comes The List of
perfect prospects for your organization and sales team to
target.

If you're a normal small business, you've probably gotten to where you
are with a less-than-perfect approach to finding customers.
When you were getting the business
off the ground, any customer that paid was considered a good one.
As a result, you probably have
some customers that are not in your target market.
Maybe they're not profitable or
they make ridiculous demands. Maybe you don't even like
them.

A problem for most companies is that they take a buckshot approach to
sales and marketing. By defining your target market and
creating The List, you're abandoning the shotgun approach for the rifle
approach. As a result, your sales and
marketing efforts will be much more
efficient.

A crucial step to getting sales back on track during the turnaround of
our real estate sales training company involved determining who our
ideal target market was. Eventually, we realized that it
was the presidents and CEOs of real estate organizations with 200 or
more agents (demographic) in North America (geographic) that saw the
value and need for outside sales training
(psychographic).

With this clarity, we ran the filter (which meant that we researched
every industry publication, database, and resource) to find out who and
how many there were. We came up with a total of 525.
At our next quarterly meeting with
all of our trainers, we did a skit with a biblical theme that included
music and dress. We created a large binder with The
List on the cover. It contained contact information
and relevant details on 525 presidents and
CEOs.

We distributed those names to our 30 trainers, who were our sales
force, and they went to work. By focusing on The List, we were
able to turn sales around. Ultimately, we were able to
penetrate and maintain over 50 percent of The List as our clients.
This was not an anomaly.
Every client that defines its
target market creates this laser focus as a
result.

*Examples*Image One: IT directors in companies with
25 or more laser printers in Michigan and
Ohio

McKinley: Opportunistic, value-added, or
underperforming apartments, shopping centers, and office buildings in
Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Virginia, Georgia, and
Florida

Identity Marketing and Public Relations: Small to mid-sized
privately held business-to-business companies in the U.S.
that meet our
profile

Defining your target market is rewarding. The difference in my
clients' attitude and awareness after doing so is like night and day.
Where they used to try to lasso
every customer in sight, they now know in the first 15 minutes of
talking to a prospect whether they are right or not.
As a result, they are bringing on
better clients with less hassles and more profit.
They no longer waste valuable time
with prospects that are not right for them.
In addition, they've dropped
existing customers that are not in their target market and creating
stress via unreasonable demands and low
profitability.

How to Make The List

Have everyone on the leadership team brainstorm what they believe to be
the following:

     • The geographic characteristics of your ideal customers.
Where are
they?

     • The demographic characteristics of your ideal customers.
What are they?
(If you're marketing
business-to-business, consider characteristics such as job title,
industry, size, and type of business. If business-to-consumer,
then age, sex, income or profession.)

     • The psychographic characteristics of your ideal customers.
How do they think?
What do they need?
What do they
appreciate?

With the answers to these questions, go to work on creating The List,
which consists of the key contact information for each prospect.
I won't kid you---creating The
List will take some work. It involves a combination of
examining your current prospect lists, generating referrals from
existing clients, reading trade publications, purchasing lists, asking
around, and telling your salespeople to keep their ears to the ground.
You have to harvest and then
stockpile these names in a database. Once they're compiled,
your sales/marketing manager has a list of all of your prospects in one
place or at least knows where they are and manages them accordingly,
confirming that the sales and marketing efforts are laser-focused on
them.

Determine the best way to reach these people by using your newly
clarified marketing strategy, which you will complete at the end of this
section. Most companies realize that the
best way to reach their newly clarified target market is through
referrals, using their clients to connect with their prospects.
You have a variety of options to
reach your target market; it all depends on the best approach for your
company. McKinley uses banking
relationships; Image One uses a combination of cold calls, referrals,
and direct mail; and ZenaComp uses networking.
Once you're clear on your core
values, core focus, 10-year target, and marketing strategy, the answer
should present itself. With this clarity, you can
move
forward with a targeted approach to your sales and marketing efforts.
That will create a growing
snowball until you reach a point at which the sales effort becomes
self-perpetuating. The task of generating new
business will then require considerably less effort than it did in the
beginning.

Add your Target Market to the V/TO.

YOUR THREE UNIQUES

Other common marketing terms for this are "differentiators" and "value
proposition." Plainly put, these are what make
you different, what make you stand out, and what you're competing with.
If you line yourself up against 10
of your competitors, you might all share one of these uniques.
Some of you may even share two,
but no one else should have the three you do.
You need to settle on three
qualities that will truly make your company unique to the ideal
customer.

Again, what you're creating here is focus.
The most common mistake that most
organizations make involves competing in too many sectors, markets,
services, or product lines, and trying to be all things to all people.
It's a game you will not
win.

Rather than your salespeople saying, "Yes, we do that, and oh yes,
we'll do that," to everything, they should be saying, "If you're looking
for that, we probably aren't the company for you.
What we excel at are these three
things." The reality is that if those
people don't want what you have to offer, they're not the right clients
for you in the first place. In the end, you're both going to
end up unhappy anyway.

Southwest Airlines is a great example of this.
It focuses on low fares, on-time
flights, and having fun. That's what drives everything in
that organization's business model. If you've flown on
Southwest, you know it doesn't offer any frills.
As a result, it doesn't appeal to
everyone, but that's okay. Southwest matters to its ideal
customer and that's all that counts.

In the company's book *Nuts!
Southwest Airlines' Crazy Recipe
for Business and Personal Success* is a story about a woman who
sent Southwest a complaint letter after every
flight she
took. She would complain about problems
such as the lack of assigned seating, the lack of a first-class section,
the lack of meals, the flight attendants' uniforms, and the casual
atmosphere. According to the book, one of the
letters made it up to the desk of then-CEO Herb Kelleher.
It took him 60 seconds to write
back the following note: "Dear Mrs. Crabapple, we will miss
you. Love,
Herb."

If you believe in your Three Uniques, and you believe they matter to
your ideal customer, you should never apologize for
them.

How to Choose Your Three Uniques

For this step, you might consider including your sales team in the
marketing strategy sessions. List everything that you believe
makes your people, company, product, or service.
What do your ideal customers think
is unique about you? Ask them---it's a 10-minute phone
call.

Through the process of elimination, make some tough decisions.
Debate and decide which are the
three that truly make you unique, and which matter to you and your
customer. The individual uniques don't have
to be different from those of your competition.
It's the combination of all Three
Uniques that makes you different. No one else should do
all three the way you do.

Add your Three Uniques to the V/TO.

YOUR PROVEN PROCESS

My dad always teaches, "Never tell someone something you can show
them." In most companies, when
salespeople are meeting with a prospective new customer, they normally
try to win new business by using countless words and visuals in the form
of pages and charts. When it's all said and done, they
end up looking just like everyone else.

There is a proven way you provide your service or product to your
customers. You do it every time, and it
produces the same result. It's what got you where you are.
What you need to do is capture
that process in a visual format to guide your sales team.
It should be encompassed on one
single piece of paper, it must illustrate your proven process, and it
must have a name. It should show each step, from the
first client interaction to the ongoing follow-up once your product or
service has been delivered.

There are typically three to seven major steps in any company's proven
process. The EOS Process is shown on the
next page as an example. Creating a standard proven process
to use in selling situations will give you two very powerful advantages.
It will increase your potential
customers' confidence and peace of mind in doing business with you.
Second, as most other companies
don't illustrate how they work, it will make you stand out among the
competition.

Rather than giving them a sales presentation and inundating them with
information, you're saying, "Let me show you exactly how we are able to
accomplish great results for our customers.
We have a proven process that we
follow called The (your company name)
Difference."

An ancillary benefit of creating your proven process is that it will
help your organization internally. Each person in the
organization will know how his or her actions affect the customer and
why his or her step in the process is
important.

How to Create Your Proven Process
Step 1

With your team, illustrate on a whiteboard what you believe are the
major steps in your proven process and then give each step a name.
These major steps are the touch
points with your customers when you interface with them.
The rule of thumb is three to
seven steps.

*Example*

It took financial services company Schechter Wealth Strategies about
three hours to create its proven process. After much discussion
and debate, the team agreed they had six steps in their proven
process:

      1. Discovery

      2. Solution Presentation
I

      3. Competitive
Bidding

      4. Solution Presentation
II

      5. Solution
Implementation

      6. Review and
Service

Step 2

Once your steps have been determined, add two to five bullets under
each item for your salespeople to use as talking points when selling to
a prospective customer. For example, in Schechter's case,
under Step 1, there are three bullets: (1) about us, (2) about you, and
(3) defining your objectives.

Step 3

Give your proven process a name. If you cannot come up
with a name, simply call it "Our Proven Process" or "The (your company
name) Difference," as many EOS clients do.

Step 4

Once you've hammered out your proven process, turn your work over to a
graphic designer to give it a visual based on your company's colors,
logo, and look and feel. As a result of all the work you've
done, this should be relatively inexpensive.
The graphic designer simply needs
to design your proven process in a way that is appealing to you, your
people, and your customers.

Step 5

Have it professionally printed, in color, on a heavy stock, and/or
laminated. This will increase the perceived
value considerably in the eyes of your prospective
customers.

Add the name of your Proven Process to the
V/TO.

YOUR GUARANTEE

The fourth and final element of your marketing strategy is your
guarantee. Think of what Federal Express did
with overnight delivery: "When it absolutely, positively has to be there
overnight." Domino's did the same with pizza
delivery: "Thirty minutes or it's free." Now hospital ERs are
adopting the idea with waiting room times, guaranteeing a wait of 30
minutes or less. Some even guarantee no wait at
all.

A guarantee is your opportunity to pinpoint an industry-wide problem
and solve it. This is typically a service or
quality problem. You must determine what your
customers can count on from you. If you guarantee it, that will put
their minds at ease and enable you to close more
business.

Some businesses are not suitable for guarantees.
Fifty percent of EOS clients do
not have guarantees because they haven't been able to come up with a
great one that will drive more business. You will not go out of
business without a guarantee, but you will attain your vision faster
with one. You're actually closing less
business now because you're not entirely putting your prospective
customers' minds at ease. If you can do that, you will gain
more customers.

Image One came up with a guarantee that it has been capitalizing on for
over eight years. The biggest single problem its
customers faced in the laser printer service business was losing days of
productivity as a result of their printers being down.
Co-owner Joel Pearlman solved it
by guaranteeing, "Four hours or it's free."

Your guarantee has a secondary benefit. It forces all the people
in your organization to deliver on it. That in turn forces you
to look inward and make sure you've got all the right people, processes,
and systems in place to do so. If not, you'll be forced to
improve upon it. Your client will never need to
make good on that guarantee if you're at your absolute
best.

How to Select Your Guarantee

Brainstorm with your leadership team and list what you believe to be
the biggest frustrations, fears, and worries for your potential customer
when doing business with you. The ideal guarantee is backed up
by a tangible penalty if you don't deliver on
it. Your guarantee must drive more
business or enable you to close more of what you're not winning.
If it doesn't, you shouldn't waste
your time using it.

It's a good idea to ask a few ideal current customers or prospects for
their feedback. Sometimes my clients have a hard
time with the word "guarantee." In these cases, call it a pledge,
commitment, or promise. This seems to move the creative
thinking process forward.

List all the possible guarantees you'd be willing to offer that will
put your potential customers' minds at ease and close more business.
From there, choose the best one.
If it meets all of the above
criteria and you believe it is the right one, then roll it
out.

You may not get this one on the first try.
Be patient and the right guarantee
will come. The awareness alone will start to
give you and your team ideas. For example, I was driving by a
collision shop the other day and saw that it had a banner that read,
"Free Loaners." It's addressing its customers'
biggest frustration: being without a car. On the radio, I heard a
mortgager guarantee any loan in 14 days or you get \$500.
Once you're aware of them, you'll
see and hear guarantees everywhere. Yours will
come.

Add your guarantee to the V/TO.

Now that the four elements of your marketing strategy are clearly
defined, it's time to pull the entire marketing strategy section
together. You can now clearly communicate a
consistent marketing strategy for the entire organization to support,
which clarifies for everyone what they must deliver.
This becomes the foundation for
all of your sales and marketing materials, messages, and presentations
moving forward.

Go after all of the prospects on The List, communicating with them why
you're unique, showing them your proven process for doing business, and
offering them your guarantee. This incredible precision in your
sales and marketing efforts will increase your sales
dramatically.

WHAT IS YOUR THREE-YEAR PICTURE?

With the first four sections of the V/TO complete, you now know who you
are, what you are, where you're going, and what marketing strategy
you're going to use to get there. It's now time to
illustrate what your business will look like three short years from
now.

With life and business moving as fast as it does in the 21st century,
there is little value in detailed strategic planning beyond a three-year
window. A lot can change during that time
span. For the investment of time and
money into that kind of planning, there is typically very little return.
It's still valuable, however, to
create a picture of the future organization three years out.
This will accomplish two vital
objectives. First, your people will be able to
"see" what you're saying and determine if they want to be part of that
scenario. Assuming they do, if they can see
the vision, it's more likely to happen. Second, it greatly
improves the one-year planning process. With the three-year
picture clearly in mind, you can more easily determine what you have to
do in the next 12 months to stay on track. As Napoleon Hill said,
"Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can surely
achieve."

As you can see on the V/TO, the three-year picture is composed of
measurables at the top and bullet points to create the picture.
It's simple but powerful.
Do not underestimate the
importance of this section, but also don't overthink it.
You're painting a picture of the
destination, not discussing every obstacle along the
way.

PAINT THE THREE-YEAR PICTURE

Schedule an hour with your leadership team.
Once you're assembled, have a copy
of the V/TO placed in front of each member.
Begin by selecting a future date.
I recommend keeping it within the
end of the calendar year, thus making it easier for people to
envision.

Next, determine the revenue picture. Start by asking your
team this question: What is the annual revenue going to be three years
from now? This is always fun, because you
find out if your leadership is in sync with how fast you want to grow.
You will typically get a range,
but you'll have to settle at one number. One new client's range
was between \$20 million and \$100 million.
Can you imagine how different
those individual future views must have been?
They can't coexist
in the
same company without creating complexity, confusion, and frustration.
That client eventually got
everyone on the same page with a figure of \$30
million.

Wolff Group originally had a range of \$10 to 25 million, with two
co-owners at either end of the spectrum. At the time, it was a
\$4 million company with 51 employees. Through much discussion,
debate, and study, it settled on \$15 million, and both owners, along
with the entire leadership team, ended up on the same page and equally
excited for their future. The need to create a three-year
picture becomes more and more evident every time I work with a
client.

The next step is to agree on the profit number.
This will be a similar
conversation, but should be settled much more quickly.
After that, you'll want to
determine your specific measurables. Measurables give
everyone scope and size. Every organization has one or two
very specific figures that are a telltale sign of the size of the
organization. It might be a number of clients,
large clients, units, or widgets produced.

Atlas Oil Company supplies fuel to gas stations, and its measurable is
gallons. Last year, it moved 725 million
gallons. In its three-year picture, its
measurable is over a billion. This number shows scope and size,
and it forces the team to think about what it will take to almost double
the size of the organization in three years.
Equally as important, it confirms
that the leadership is in agreement and ready for that type of growth.
Another example is Zoup!, a
company that franchises a casual soup-and-sandwich concept.
Its measurable is its number of
stores. Last year, Zoup!
had 38 stores; its three-year
picture measurable is 94.

Once you've determined your numbers, have everyone on the leadership
team take a few minutes and write down bullet points of what the
organization will look like on that date three years from now.
Factors to consider include things
such as number and quality of people, added resources, office
environment and size, operational efficiencies, systemization,
technology needs, product mix, and client
mix.

Combine these results, and after some discussion and debate, your
three-year picture will typically contain 10 to 20 bullet points that
describe what your organization will look like.
In addition, each person on the
leadership team should
verbalize his or her vision for his or her individual role in the
organization in that time frame. You'll gain some interesting
insights into people's motivations and help get everyone's expectations
in line.

You cannot move on and finalize your three-year picture until everyone
on the leadership team sees it clearly. At this point, everyone
in the room should close his or her eyes as one person reads the
three-year picture out loud. The picture must be visible in
each person's mind. Each must believe in it and
ultimately want it. After all, they are the team that
needs to make it happen. In this session, encourage people
to speak up, debate and go back and forth, but ultimately they must
agree on all of the major points. You now have a
three-year picture that you can take to your organization at
large.

Add your three-year picture to the V/TO.

WHAT IS YOUR ONE-YEAR PLAN?

We're now going to the traction side of the V/TO, which is about
bringing your long-range vision down to the ground and making it real.
That means deciding on what must
get done this year.

Remember, less is always more. Most companies make the mistake of
trying to accomplish too many objectives per year.
By trying to get everything done
all at once, they end up accomplishing very little and feeling
frustrated. One client of mine was very
stubborn about this point for the first two years.
I would tell him to limit the
company goals between three and seven, and each year we set goals, he
would keep piling on more. When we were done, the company
would have 12 to 15 goals for the year. Like clockwork, at the
end of the year, they would accomplish very little and end up
frustrated. Going into the third year, he
finally had a revelation: They were taking on too much.
With this awareness, we agreed
that the team could choose only three goals for the coming year.
They did, and by the end of the
year, they accomplished all three, increased sales by 19 percent, and
had their most profitable year in five years.
When everything is important,
nothing is important. The EOS approach is going to force
you to focus on a few goals rather than too many.
By doing that, you will actually
accomplish more. That is the power of
focus.

HOW TO CREATE YOUR ONE-YEAR PLAN

Schedule two hours with your leadership team.
When everyone is sitting at the
table, decide on the future date. It's highly recommended
you keep within either a calendar year or your fiscal year, regardless
of where you are in the year. So, if it's July, set your future
date as December 31. After that time, you'll be able to
set a brand-new full one-year plan. Having a partial-year
plan allows you to gain experience with the process between now and
then.

As with the three-year picture, again, decide on the numbers.
What is your annual revenue goal?
What is your profit goal?
What is the measurable?
This number should be consistent
with the three-year picture measurable.

With the three-year picture in mind, discuss, debate, and decide on the
three to seven most important priorities that must be completed this
year in order for you to be on track for your three-year picture.
These become your goals.
They need to be specific,
measurable, and attainable. This is an important point.
I cannot tell you how many times
when reviewing one-year goals at the end of the year, I observe clients
debating what the goal actually meant. To avoid this, the goal
must be specific, leaving no wiggle room. An outsider should be
able to read it and know what it means. Remember, measurable
means you can measure it. "Sales" is not a specific goal,
but "\$1 million in new sales" is. "Improve customer
satisfaction" is not a specific goal, but "increase average customer
rating to a 9" is.

"Attainable" means that it's doable. Setting unrealistic
goals is the biggest trap entrepreneurs fall into.
The team has to believe it's
possible to hit the goal, or else you can't hold someone accountable to
it. If every goal is a "stretch goal,"
how do you know what success is? Goals are set to be
achieved.

Make sure you have a projected budget in place that supports your
one-year plan. Many companies set goals for the
year with no financial projection to confirm that the plan is even
feasible. A budget will force you to confirm
that you have all of the resources you need to achieve the plan and that
when you achieve the revenue goal, the profit number is realistic.
Almost every time a profit goal is
first projected, the discussion lowers the number as reality is brought
to bear.

Add your one-year plan to the V/TO.

WHAT ARE YOUR QUARTERLY ROCKS?

Once your one-year plan is clear, you need to narrow your vision all
the way down to what really matters: the next 90 days.
You should determine what the most
important priorities are in the coming quarter.
Those priorities are called
Rocks.

Quarterly Rocks create a 90-Day World for your organization, a powerful
concept that enables you to gain tremendous traction.
How do they work?
Every 90 days, your leadership
team comes together to establish its priorities for the next 90 days
based on your one-year plan. You discuss and ultimately
conclude what has to be executed in the next quarter to put you on track
for the one-year plan, which in turn puts you on track for the
three-year picture, and so on.

In a growing organization, it's normal to battle for resources, time,
and attention. There will be tension.
But when you have finished setting
your Rocks and all the dust has settled, you should all be united on
what objectives take precedence in the coming quarter.
The focus of the Rocks is what
makes this process so productive. Most organizations enter
the next quarter battling on all fronts. They make everything a
priority and accomplish very little. By setting Rocks every
quarter as a team, you gain considerably more traction and finally reach
your goals.

The complete process of setting Rocks is addressed in
Chapter
8.
Once they are set, add them to
your V/TO.

WHAT ARE YOUR ISSUES?

The eighth and final section in the V/TO is the Issues List.
While it may seem strange to
include a list of problems as part of your vision, that list is actually
as important as the previous seven questions.
Now that you clearly know where
you're going, you have to identify all of the obstacles that could
prevent you from reaching your targets.

The sooner you accept that you have issues, the better off you're going
to be. You will always have them; your
success is in direct proportion to your ability to solve them.
Your leadership team should state
them openly and honestly so that you can get them out of your heads and
into writing. In doing so, you're taking the
first step to solving them.

HOW TO IDENTIFY YOUR ISSUES

This exercise can be done very quickly, in 15 minutes at most.
Ask the team to think of the
obstacles, concerns, and opportunities you face in achieving your
vision. From there, let the opinions fly.
Don't sugarcoat them.
Encourage an open atmosphere where
they can all come out.

Through answering the eight questions laid out in this chapter as a
team, most of the issues will emerge. They'll come up when
your team says something like, "But what about ..." and, "We can't do
that because ..." or, "Bill won't buy into it because ..." These are all
issues. By the end of this book, you'll
have developed a sixth sense for capturing issues.
From there, you will develop a
discipline for adding them to the Issues List.
You'll know when the Issues List
truly has become a habit, because the next time you get hit with an
obstacle, you'll simply say, "There's another one," and add it to the
list.

After all of the issues are out in the open, add them to the V/TO
Issues List. Don't worry about solving them
yet. That will be addressed in
Chapter
6.

You have answered all eight questions, your vision is clear, and your
V/TO is complete. An example of what yours might
look like follows.

SHARED BY ALL

Now that you have completed your V/TO---the first part of the Vision
Component---the foundation for the rest of The EOS Process is set.
The second part is to share your
vision with your employees. The number one reason employees
don't share a company vision is that they don't know what it is.
The only way you can determine if
your vision is shared by all is simply to tell
them.

A Harris Interactive/FranklinCovey poll of over 23,000 employees in key
industries and employed in key functional areas sheds a sharp light on
this issue. The poll revealed that 37 percent
of employees didn't understand their companies' priorities.
Only one in five was enthusiastic
about their organization's goals, and only one in five saw a clear
connection between their tasks and their organization's
goals.

Now that your vision is on paper, you must communicate it to everyone
in the organization, and every person must understand it and share it.
When everyone's energy is going in
the same direction, their accumulated drive will kick in and create an
exponential force.

Don't be afraid to let your people challenge the vision and ask
questions. These inquisitions, along with the
preceding dialogue, will help you both become more invested in the
vision. While you may worry that they may
point out a flaw in the plan, that's not a bad thing at all.
If they notice and highlight a
potential problem, they'll be even more committed as a result of their
involvement in the resulting exchange and resolution.
Be willing to be
vulnerable.

Here's the brutal truth: Not everyone in your organization will share
your vision. The responsibility that you have
as the leadership team is to share your V/TO and inspire your people
with a compelling vision. As long as they understand it,
they want to be a part of it, and their actions perpetuate the vision,
they share it. The ones that don't will stand out
by contrast. Most of the time, they'll leave
before you have to let them go. But as a good manager, you'll be
doing them and others in the company a disservice by keeping them
around. You may have to help free up the
futures of the ones that don't willingly
leave.

You can effectively communicate the company vision in three
events:

      1. Have a company kickoff meeting and
unveil your clearly defined vision (the V/TO).
This is an opportunity to share
your newly created core value speech for the first time.
Make sure to include
question-and-answer time.

      2. Every 90 days, have a short (no
more than 45-minute) state-of-the-company meeting with all employees.
The objective of this event is to
share successes and progress, review the V/TO, and communicate newly set
company Rocks for the quarter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The quarterly state-of-the-company has proven to be the most
effective discipline for helping people share, understand, and buy into
the company vision. In its purest form, the meeting
has a three-part agenda.

            1. Where you've
been

            2. Where you
are

            3. Where you are
going

    Each quarter, you and your leadership team fill each of those
agenda items with three of the most relevant data points, and you'll
deliver a clear, concise, and powerful message that keeps your people in
the know. Its effectiveness stems from
delivering it every quarter and being
consistent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

      3. Each quarter, as you set Rocks in
each department, conduct a complete review of the V/TO as a
team.

Each of these three events will prompt questions and answers that
continuously clarify the vision for everyone.
You'll need to give people the
opportunity to ask questions and understand the vision.
As a result, they'll be able to
decide if this is the company they want to be a part of.
Through that process, they'll be
able to direct themselves. The core values, core focus, and
marketing strategy will always give them clear direction on their
actions and enable them to make better decisions on their own, further
enabling you to delegate and elevate.

People need to hear the vision seven times before they really hear it
for the first time. Human beings have short attention
spans and are a little jaded when it comes to new messages.
As a good leader, you must remain
consistent in your message. The first time they hear it,
they'll roll their eyes and say, "Here we go again."
(Remember, you created this
culture through past inconsistencies.) The second time, they'll still
roll their eyes a little. But by the fourth and fifth time
of hearing it, they'll realize this is for real.
By the seventh time, they'll be on
board. You'll have to adjust your outlook
from "I've told them three times---this is so frustrating!"
to "I've told them three
times---only four more to go!" Be patient, and remember that this
is a journey.

Here are some additional real-life examples of how companies share
their vision with employees:

RE/MAX First: Each member of the seven-person
leadership team took 12 people apiece (84 total), taught them
one-on-one, and quizzed them on their Three
Uniques.

McKinley: Took their 12 mid-managers,
divided them among the leadership team members, and mentored
them.

The Professional Group: Conducted on-the-spot core
value checks. If someone could name them all,
they'd receive a \$20 bill on the spot.

Other EOS clients have enlarged the V/TO and posted it somewhere in the
office for everyone to see.

I also learned of a company that offered a weekly \$20 gift card,
albeit with a unique twist. The employee that received it the
previous week would give it to the next employee who exhibited one of
the company's core values. They had to
e-mail the entire organization and tell everyone who they gave it to and
what core value that person exhibited. The gift card could
never go to the same employee until everyone received it, and it had to
cross departments each time. In 52 weeks, that company spread
52 core value stories.

You achieve your full potential when your leadership team is on the
same page with answers to the eight questions.
Everyone in the organization
shares the company vision, wants to be a part of it, and perpetuates it
with his or her actions and words.

Now you must start to make the vision a practical
reality.
