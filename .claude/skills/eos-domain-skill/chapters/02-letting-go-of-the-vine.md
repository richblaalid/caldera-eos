# Chapter 2: Letting Go of the Vine

CHAPTER 2

LETTING GO
OF THE VINE

An entrepreneur slips
and falls off the edge of a cliff. On his way down, he
manages to grab onto the end of a vine. He's hanging there, a
thousand feet from the top and a thousand feet from the bottom.
His situation seems hopeless, so
he looks up to the clouds, and decides, for the first time, to pray.
"Is anybody up there?"
he asks.
After a long silence, a deep voice
bellows down from the clouds: "*Do you
believe?*" "Yes," replies the
entrepreneur. "*Then let go of the
vine*," says the voice.
The entrepreneur pauses for a
second, looks up again, and finally responds, "Is there anybody else up
there?"

Most business owners are unable to reach the next level because they
are simply not ready to let go of the vine. You might know the
feeling; you want to see your business grow, but at the same time,
you're frustrated, tired, and unwilling to take on any more risk.
The truth is that before you can
grow, you'll need to take a leap of faith. But don't worry---you
won't have to act until you are comfortable and clear on all of the EOS
tools.

Here's a textbook example of the man hanging from the vine.
He'd only started The EOS Process
because his head of sales and marketing had begged him to.
At the time, this man had his
hands in every aspect of the business. His makeshift leadership
team was a sham because he pulled all the strings.
On top of that, he was logging 80
work hours a week and was overworked to the point that he'd actually
started to nod off during meetings. He was a
zombie.

But once, in an uncharacteristic moment of vulnerability, he admitted
to me in confidence that he didn't want to live that way any longer.
He put his faith in The EOS
Process, and in two years he managed to elevate himself to a true leader
for an organization that had a solid leadership team in place.
Now, he spends more time with his
family, he's decidedly less stressed, and he's generating more profit
than ever.

If you're not happy with the current state of your company, you have
three choices. You can live with it, leave it, or
change it. If the first two are not an
option, it's time to admit that you don't want to live this way any
longer.

Change is scary. You're not alone in feeling
anxious about jeopardizing what you already have.
But despite these worries, it's
time for a shift in thinking. You need to change from believing
that you are your company and letting it become its own entity.
With the right vision, structure,
and people in place, your company can evolve and realize its full
potential. To be truly ready for this change,
you must be willing to embrace the following four fundamental
beliefs:

      1. You must build and maintain a true
leadership team.

      2. Hitting the ceiling is
inevitable.

      3. You can only run your business on
one operating system.

      4. You must be open-minded,
growth-oriented, and vulnerable.

BUILDING A TRUE LEADERSHIP TEAM

Would you prefer a dictatorship or a true leadership team approach to
running your business? Both leadership methods can work,
so you have to decide. The philosophy of this book
advocates a healthy leadership team approach, where you build a team of
people that define the company's vision with you.
These leaders all have clear
accountabilities and must be able to take initiative over their
respective departments. You must also all remain open and
honest about all issues and be willing to fight for what is best for the
company as a whole.

Dictatorships not only are exhausting, but also preclude future growth.
It's simple math.
One person can only make so many
decisions and solve so many problems. You cannot build an
enduring, successful organization that lives beyond you if your
organization is designed to crumble the minute you step
aside.

Until now, you've probably been holding all the pieces together on your
own. But once your organization reaches
a certain size, you won't be able to lead that way.
If you want to grow, it's not
possible to maintain a hand in sales, service, accounting, complaints,
and follow-up on a regular basis.

This means that it's time to let others take control of those areas,
and that you have to decide who you want to do so.
Each of your departmental heads
should be better than you in his or her respective position.
Of course, you will need to give
them clear expectations and instill a system for effective communication
and accountability. Once you have the right people in
the right seats, let them run with it.

Your job right now is to select these people wisely.
If they don't already work in your
organization, you'll have to find them elsewhere.
Best-selling author and highly
sought-after speaker Patrick Lencioni summarizes this very point in his
book *Obsessions of an Extraordinary
Executive: The Four Disciplines at the Heart of Making Any Organization
World Class*. His first rule of
building a healthy organization: "Build and maintain a cohesive
leadership team."

Once your team is in place, each member needs to agree that the
problems in the organization are also his or her responsibility.
Once you take responsibility for a
problem, you can help to solve it. Don't worry if you don't
know how to solve a particular problem just yet---that will all be
covered by the Issues Solving Track in Chapter
6.

The next leap of faith you have to take is this: As goes the leadership
team, so goes the company. Your leadership team must present
a united front to the rest of your organization.
In a nuclear family, when the
child doesn't like the answer from Mom, he or she might go to Dad.
In your company, there can be only
one answer, and your leadership team needs to parent everyone to
greatness.

HITTING THE CEILING IS INEVITABLE

Organizations usually expand in spurts, by smashing through a series of
ceilings. Reaching the natural limits of
your existing resources is a by-product of growth, and a company
continually needs to adjust its existing
state if it hopes to expand through the next ceiling.
You and your leadership team need
to understand this, because you will hit the ceiling on three different
levels: as an organization, departmentally, and as
individuals.

In all of these instances, growth is your only option.
If you're not growing, be it
internally or externally, you're dying. Most companies strive
for external growth, but internal growth also leads to future greatness.
In fact, most companies
*need* to start with a focus
on internal growth before they can even think about external growth.
The paradox is that they will
actually grow faster externally in the long run if they are focused
internally from the outset.

Schechter Wealth Strategies (SWS) exemplifies this point.
Founded by Robert Schechter in
1971, SWS built a solid organization with a great reputation.
After being joined by his son Marc
and his son-in-law Jason Zimmerman, Schechter decided to aggressively
grow the company. Unfortunately, their internal
operations were already at capacity, chaotic, and in need of
reorganizing before the company could hope to expand.
With a powerhouse sales team, a
strong culture, and great product offerings, their only barrier was
operations capacity. They had hoped to get operations
open for business within a few months. To meet this extremely
aggressive timeline, they needed to change their corporate structure,
reassess their staff, and make their processes
consistent.

Through hard work, focus, and determination, they eventually achieved
this goal. They clarified their vision, set
up the right structure, put great people in place, and streamlined their
processes. After a little more than a year,
their reorganization was finally open for business.
That may seem like a large time
investment, but it couldn't have happened any faster, and the results
now speak for themselves. Thanks to their very talented
team, they have grown an average of 50 percent per year for the last
three years. In the long run, they have grown
faster than if they had started aggressively selling and forced the new
business into an operational structure that couldn't handle the
increased sales. The entire structure might have
imploded, causing them to upset and lose valuable customers.
Instead, the patience and hard
work they put in paid off. If your organization needs an
internal transformation first, be honest with yourself and spend the
next one or two years growing internally and honing your business model
so it can support external revenue growth.

But regardless of whether you grow inside or out, you're going to hit
the ceiling. While there are a lot of differing
statistics out there on the subject, they all point to the same
conclusion: Many organizations fail because they're unable to survive
these growing pains. On its official website, the U.S.
Small Business Administration
purports that "roughly 50 percent of small businesses fail within the
first five years." In a study published by the
Monthly Labor Review in 2005, economist Amy E.
Knaup states that 56 percent of
businesses die within the first four years. And in his book
*The
E-Myth* and *The E-Myth
Revisited*, author Michael Gerber paints an
even scarier picture, saying that 80 percent of businesses fail in their
first five years and 80 percent of those remaining will fail somewhere
between years six through ten.

The good news is that you can survive hitting the ceiling by choosing a
leadership team that possesses five core leadership abilities.
Above all else, your leaders need
to be able to simplify, delegate, predict, systemize, and structure.
To the degree that you and your
team apply these five abilities, you will grow to the next level.
Let's take a look at them one by
one.

SIMPLIFY

The acronym KISS ("keep it simple, stupid") is your mantra here.
Simplifying your organization is
key. This entails streamlining the
rules you operate under as well as how they're communicated.
The same goes for your processes,
systems, messages, and vision. Most organizations are too complex
when they begin. Use models, visuals, acronyms, and
checklists to simplify processes and procedures, because as your
organization grows, it will get more complex.
Henry David Thoreau got to the
core of the issue in *Walden*, but Ralph Waldo
Emerson later did him one better:

      "Simplify, simplify." Henry David
Thoreau

      "One 'simplify' would have sufficed."
Ralph Waldo
Emerson

Dan Sullivan, the creator of The Strategic
Coach^®^ Program, makes the
point as follows: "No further progress and growth is possible for an
organization until a new state of simplicity is created."
With its many tools, the entire
EOS process is designed to help you create that new state of simplicity.
It's a common thread you'll see
over and over again throughout this book: Less is
more.

DELEGATE

Your ability to break through the ceiling also depends on your ability
to delegate. Be prepared to "delegate and
elevate" to your true god-given skill set. You'll have to delegate
some of your responsibilities and elevate yourself to operate at your
highest and best use. It's not practical for you to
remain chef, head waiter, and dishwasher as your company grows.
By hanging on to all the tiny
details, you're actually constricting the company's growth.
When you experience that personal
growth, the company will grow under you. This is exactly what is
meant by letting go of the vine.

When you let go, however, you need to make sure you're letting go of
the right duties. The responsibilities that you
delegate to other people have to be tasks that you have outgrown.
These include things such as
opening mail, writing proposals, approving invoices, and handling
customer complaints. Sometimes we're afraid to pass off
jobs that aren't much fun for others, but, at a certain point, you'll
have to. The beauty of this transition is
that there are people who have the skills and enthusiasm to do these
jobs.

Not only will you need to learn how to delegate and elevate, but the
people around you will as well. Just as you need to figure out how
to build an extension of yourself, your team can also extend the company
by building teams under them, thus ensuring the company's continued
growth.

PREDICT

Prediction in business is done on two basic levels: Long-term and
Short-term.

Long-term prediction. Publicly held companies
predict earnings. When they later announce their
actual earnings, either they hit the prediction or they don't.
If they hit it, their stock
continues to climb. If they miss, their stock simply
drops. In a small to mid-size privately
held organization, you don't have the luxury of missing your prediction.
If you do, it may put you out of
business.

Long-term predicting is the forecast of everything 90 days and beyond.
To do so, your leadership team has
to know where the organization is going and how you expect to get there.
You do this by starting with the
far future and working your way back. What is your 10-year
target? What is your three-year picture?
Your one-year
plan? What do you have to accomplish in
the next 90 days in order to be on track?

At first, this task may seem daunting, so let's take a little pressure
off. No one has a crystal ball.
No one can know what will happen
tomorrow with certainty. Long-term predicting is not really
about foretelling what will happen; it's making a decision about what
you will do tomorrow based on what you know
today.

Put another way, your leadership team has to "climb the tree" more
often than others. I liken long-term prediction to a
team of short-sighted people cutting a road through a jungle.
They may be the most productive
team that's ever cut a road, or they may be twice as productive as any
other team before them. However, if there's no leader
there to climb a tree and tell them where the road is going, they might
very well be cutting a zigzag. Get good at taking the long view.
As leaders, you'll need to stop
working in the business 100 percent of the time, and as Michael Gerber,
author of *The
E-Myth* and *The E-Myth
Revisited*, puts it, work
*on* the business every so
often instead. This discipline will get you to
where you want to go faster.

Short-term prediction. While the long-term view
addresses business needs 90 days and beyond, short-term focuses on the
immediate future. These are the issues that will
arise on a daily or weekly basis, and your ability to solve them will
affect the long-term greater good of the
organization.

As a leader in an organization, you're probably hit with at least half
a dozen problems a day. Most leaders are so buried in the
day-to-day grind that they'll typically think up flimsy workarounds just
to get nagging issues out of their way so they can make it to the next
week. If this happens long enough, their
whole organization will come to be held together by duct tape and twine,
and it will ultimately implode. You'll need to do a good job of
predicting so that you can make those problems go away forever and avoid
a similar fate.

SYSTEMIZE

There was probably a time when your business demanded that you fly by
the seat of your pants. This involved reacting to every
customer request, thinking on your toes, and being creative on the fly.
At some point, though, certain
actions have revealed themselves as redundant.
That's when you should systemize
them.

There are really only a handful of core processes that make any
organization function. Systemizing involves clearly
identifying what those core processes are and integrating them into a
fully functioning machine. You will have a human resource
process, a marketing process, a sales process, an operating process, a
customer-retention process, an accounting process, and so on.
These must all work together in
harmony, and the methods you use should be crystal clear to everyone at
all levels of the organization.

The first step is to agree as a leadership team on what these processes
are and then to give them a name. This is your company's
*Way* of doing business.
Once you all agree on your
*Way*, you will simplify,
apply technology to, document, and fine-tune these core processes.
In doing so, you will realize
tremendous efficiencies, eliminate mistakes, and make it easier for
managers to manage and for you to increase your
profitability.

By systemizing your organization, you will start to see how all five
leadership abilities work together to break through the ceiling.
There is a direct correlation
between organizational adherence to core processes and your own ability
to let go. Handing over a turnkey system to
an accountable leader makes it easier for you to delegate and elevate.
As long as he or she follows the
process and possesses the skill set to do the job, you'll be confident
that the job at hand will be accomplished
correctly.

STRUCTURE

Lastly, you and your leadership team will need to structure your
organization correctly. Your company needs to be organized
in a way that reduces complexity and creates accountability.
In addition, this structure should
also be designed to boost you to the next level.
Too many organizations become
stuck because they are set in their old ways and unwilling to change to
fit their expansion.

Unfortunately, the structures of most small companies are either too
loose or non-existent. Many of them have structures
governed by ego, personality, and fear. You'll learn how to use
the Accountability Chart so that you don't fall into this trap.
This will enable you to implement
a structure that encourages expansion and clearly defines everyone's
roles and responsibilities.

In summary, once you understand that hitting the ceiling is inevitable,
you and your leadership team must employ these five leadership abilities
to reach the next level: (1)
simplify the organization, (2) delegate and elevate, (3) predict both
long-term and short-term, (4) systemize, and (5) structure your company
the right way. The tools you're about to learn
are all designed specifically to help you acquire those
abilities.

YOU CAN ONLY RUN YOUR BUSINESS ON ONE OPERATING
SYSTEM

You must have one abiding vision, one voice, one culture, and one
operating system. This includes a uniform approach
to how you meet, how you set priorities, how you plan and set your
vision, the terminology you use, and the way you communicate with
employees. EOS is an operating system that
puts everybody on the same page. Just as a computer program is made
up of components that organize activity and various data into a system
that enables its users to be more productive, EOS does the same for a
business.

If you assessed a handful of talented entrepreneurs, CEOs, sales
managers, marketing directors, operations people, and finance people on
leadership teams solely as individuals, you'd probably bet on their
company being a success. But even talented leaders can't be
effective without first settling on a single operating system for their
company.

Often two talented people can speak two completely different
languages:

      "What are your objectives?" "You mean my
goals?"

      "What is the process?" "You mean the
procedure?"

      "No, that's a system."

      "I prefer to set monthly objectives."
"We've always set them weekly, and
we call them action items."

Imagine coaching a sports team with two distinct methods or running a
country with two governments. When systems work at cross
purposes, your company is the ultimate loser.
You cannot build a great
organization on multiple operating systems---you must choose one.
This book is offering you
EOS.

YOU MUST BE OPEN-MINDED, GROWTH-ORIENTED, AND
VULNERABLE

The late Dr. David Viscott, author of
*Risking*, wrote, "If you cannot
risk, you cannot grow. If you cannot grow, you cannot
become your best. If you cannot become your best,
you cannot be happy. If you cannot be happy, what else
matters?"

Similarly, in your business environment, you have to be willing to be
open to new and different ideas. If you don't know something, you
have to admit that you don't know. You have to be willing
to ask for and receive help. Most of all, you have to know your
strengths and weaknesses and let other people who are more skilled than
you in a certain area take charge.

Hard experience taught me the value of this belief.
After one particularly
unsuccessful engagement, I reflected back on why The EOS Process did not
work. It came down to a simple truth:
The members of the leadership team weren't growth-oriented, either
internally or externally, nor were they willing to be vulnerable or
open-minded. We accomplished very little
because it was a constant battle to make decisions and discuss difficult
issues. As a result, we both ended up
dissatisfied. I now look for these warning signs
in initial interviews with potential new clients.
In many cases, I'm forced to help
clients understand why they are not ready for The EOS
Process.

You cannot embark on this journey if you're not willing to be
vulnerable. You have to let your guard down to
see your organization for what it is. Eliminate the facade
with your leadership team, and invite openness and honesty.
The leader who feels he has to
have all of the answers and can never be wrong is completely missing the
point. Being open-minded means being open
to new ideas and being ready to change for the better.
When your arms are folded, the
wall is up and there is no getting in. The mind is like a
parachute---it has to be open to work.

You must also be growth-oriented to take this journey.
I have met many people who say
they want to grow, only to discover after further questioning that they
are petrified by the challenge and turbulence that growth creates.
They are content at the size they
are, and there are many good arguments in favor of contentment.
EOS, however, is a system designed
to help you grow.

In summary, the four fundamental beliefs are as
follows:

      1. You must build and maintain a true
leadership team.

      2. Hitting the ceiling is
inevitable.

      3. You can only run your business on
one operating system.

      4. You must be open-minded,
growth-oriented, and vulnerable.

If you accept these beliefs, you're ready to let go of the vine.
Now it's time to learn the tools
that will help you rise to the next level and build a stronger
organization. Over the course of the next six
chapters, you will learn how to strengthen the Six Key Components of
your organization. As you progress, you'll better
understand the EOS structure, as well as why each component is reliant
on the next. With that in mind, let's start
where all traction starts: your vision.
