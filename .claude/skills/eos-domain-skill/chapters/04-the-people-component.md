# Chapter 4: The People Component

CHAPTER 4

THE
PEOPLE COMPONENT

SURROUND YOURSELF WITH GOOD PEOPLE

Have you ever noticed
that great leaders frequently credit their success to having "good
people"? What the heck does that even mean?
Whenever I asked these leaders
what exactly that meant, I seemed to get a different answer every time.
Eventually, I realized that the
answers were all exactly the same. Sure, the words were different,
but the context never changed. In this chapter, I'll cut through
all the confusing terminology such as "good people," "A players,"
"platinum," "top quartile," and "superstars," and get to the root of the
matter.

It all comes down to getting the right people in the right seats.
Jim Collins made this idea very
popular in his bestseller *Good to
Great*. It's an idea that has
been around for a long time. Unfortunately, there has never
been a crystal clear definition for what it actually means.
As a result, it was another term
among a complex mix of terminologies that only added to the confusion.
And yet the definition is actually
quite simple.

*The right people* are the ones who share your
company's core values. They fit and thrive in your
culture. They are people you enjoy being
around and who make your organization a better place to be.
A perfect example is the
receptionist for Autumn Associates. As she returned home
from vacation, her flight was delayed for so long that her plane landed
only an hour before she was due back to work for an 8:00 a.m.
meeting.
The employees had created a custom
of wearing logo apparel to all company meetings, so she had her mother
pick her up from the airport with her company shirt.
She changed in the car and was at
work on time, apparel and all. This exemplified two of the
company's core values---commitment and
caring. In this chapter you will be
introduced to your second EOS tool, the People Analyzer, which will cut
through the murkiness of personnel choices to show you who's right for
your company.

Core Values + People Analyzer = Right
People

*The right seat* means that each of your
employees is operating within his or her area of greatest skill and
passion inside your organization and that the roles and responsibilities
expected of each employee fit with his or her
*Unique
Ability*^®^.^1^
This is a concept created by Dan Sullivan and is a registered trademark
of The Strategic Coach, Inc. In the book
*Unique
Ability*, authors Catherine Nomura, Julia
Waller, and Shannon Waller explain that everyone has a Unique
Ability^®^.
The trick is to discover yours.
When you're operating from within
your Unique Ability^®^, your superior skill
is often noticed by others who value it. You experience
never-ending improvement, feel energized rather than drained, and, most
of all, you have a passion for what you're doing that presses you to go
further than others would in this area. When this combination of
passion and talent finds the right audience, it naturally creates value
for others, who, in return, offer you greater rewards and more
opportunities for further improvement. It's like your personal
core focus. When a person is operating in his
or her Unique Ability^®^, he or she is in the
right seat.

One of the obstacles in gaining traction and achieving your vision is
that roles, responsibilities, expectations, and job descriptions are
unclear due to structural issues. A hazy structure may have gotten
you to where you are, but it will not take you any further.
A common mistake entails creating
a structure to accommodate people you like or don't want to lose.
When creating a structure to
function efficiently, you must take the long view.
Sometimes this means eliminating
or changing seats that are no longer relevant.
To break through the ceiling, you
must make sure you have the right structure in place to get you to the
next level. That leads us to the
Accountability Chart, the ultimate tool for structuring your
organization the right way, defining roles and responsibilities, and
clearly identifying all of the seats in the
organization.

Unique Ability^®^ + Accountability Chart
= Right Seats

As you move forward, you'll be faced with two types of issues regarding
your people. The first is having the right
person in the wrong seat. The second is having the wrong
person in the right seat. In order to gain traction, you'll
need to address both. Let's look at them one at a
time.

RIGHT PERSON, WRONG SEAT

In this case, you have the right person (i.e., one who shares your core
values), but he or she is truly not operating in his or her Unique
Ability^®^.
This person has been promoted to a
seat that is too big, has outgrown a seat that is too small, or has been
put in a position that does not utilize his or her Unique
Ability^®^.
Generally, this person is where he
or she is because he or she has been around a long time, you like him or
her, and he or she is a great addition to the team.
Until now, you probably believed
you were helping this person by promoting him or her to his or her
existing seat. In actuality, you were hindering
his or her growth and the growth of the company.
Your job in this situation is to
move this person out of that seat and into a seat that is right for this
person, one where he or she will be
successful.

Assuming that there is such a seat---and most of the time, there
is---the problem is solved once you move this person.
Unfortunately, sometimes there is
no seat available. In this case, you have to make a
very difficult choice. You have to make decisions for the
greater good of the business, and you don't have the luxury of keeping
people around simply because you like them. If this is the case, you
must let them go. This will be one of the toughest
issues you will have to face. Once the change is made, the
company is always better off, and usually the person is happier in the
long run.

WRONG PERSON, RIGHT SEAT

In this case, the person excels at what he or she does, is extremely
productive, and is clearly in his or her Unique
Ability^®^.
What makes this person the wrong
person is that he or she doesn't share your core values.
While this obstacle may seem like
something you can live with in the short term, that person is killing
your
organization in the long run. He or she is chipping away at what
you're trying to build, in little ways that, most of the time, you don't
even see. It's that wry comment in the
hallway, the dirty look behind your back, and the dissension that this
person spreads.

Early in the process, one client had a wrong person, right seat issue.
The company's top salesperson was
a man without integrity. While he was very friendly,
professional in his approach, and knowledgeable, he constantly shaded
the truth to make sure he had the successful quote.
His new business growth was 20
percent per year, and his clients never complained.
Because the leadership team had
not identified their core values yet, they let the situation drag on for
12 months. As they realized how he was
building the business, they faced a seemingly difficult decision.
Only after letting him go did
their employees and vendors open up about their feelings and concerns.
He was damaging the company's
reputation the entire time he worked for it.
Their core values were now in
writing, and they included integrity. "Never again will we
allow an employee to work for us without living this core value," the
owner stated.

No matter how difficult the issue is, you have to make a good business
decision here for the long haul. If you have a wrong person in the
right seat, ultimately that person must go for the sake of the greater
good.

Of course, there is a third type of people issue, and that is wrong
person, wrong seat. The solution is obvious: That
person must go. But the way you reached that point
isn't always obvious. Another client had a CFO for more
than 20 years. In the beginning, he shared the
core values, was talented, and was absolutely in the right seat.
As time went on, the business,
industry, and technology changed, and he didn't change with them.
The seat was outgrowing him.
His attitude also changed
considerably. He became resentful, aloof, and
less friendly than he used to be. He was no longer the right person
or in the right seat. The owners had not noticed the
change until the core values and the right structure were clarified and
put in place. They wrestled with the thorny
issue for a year and a half, all the while giving their CFO chances to
change with the times and adopt the new core values, to no avail.
Left with no other choice, they
replaced him with a new CFO. The difference was like night and
day. Their sessions were considerably
more productive, the finance department finally got reorganized, and the
company positioned itself to make the next leap
ahead.

Your job is to hire, fire, review, reward, and recognize all of your
people around core values and Unique
Abilities^®^.
That's the way to build an
organization with all of the right people in the right
seats.

Let's see how this can be done in practical terms.
The following tools will enable
you to assess your people and make the right choices.
We'll turn first to Right People
and then to Right Seats.

RIGHT PEOPLE

With the answer to the first question on the V/TO---"What are your core
values?"---you now have the ability to define who the right people are
for your organization. It's important to note that
whatever your core values are, they don't make the people who don't
possess them right or wrong, nor do they make them good or bad.
They just don't fit in
*your* company culture.
If they go somewhere that has
their values, they'll be fine and they'll probably thrive.
Keeping in mind your core values,
it's now time to turn to the tool that will show you what you
have.

THE PEOPLE ANALYZER

I often observed my clients discussing people issues in terms that were
very subjective and unproductive. They often never really resolved
their people issues, and when they did, the process took twice as long
as it should have. Out of necessity, I created a tool
to make such discussions much more tangible.

The People Analyzer is designed to clarify whether you have the right
person in place or not. This is one of the top five tools
used by all my clients. The concept was actually created
by my dad back in the early 1970s for evaluating salespeople, and I have
altered it into a tool that helps evaluate an individual's core values.
The People Analyzer template can
be downloaded from [www.eosworldwide.com/people](http://www.eosworldwide.com/people).

First, put the names of the people you're going to analyze in the left
column. Then list your core values across
the top. Then rate each person according to
his or her adherence to the core values. Give one of three
ratings:

            +    He or she exhibits that core value most of the
time.

            +/− Sometimes he or she exhibits the core value and
sometimes he or she doesn't.

            −    He or she doesn't exhibit the core value most of the
time.

You will notice in the preceding example, Sally is absolutely the right
person for your organization, George is very much on the fence, and John
must go.

The ideal you're shooting for in your organization is to surround
yourself with 100 percent of the right people, who look just like Sally
does. However, this is only an ideal, so
don't get caught up in perfection. What your leadership
team has to do is determine what the bar is.
The "bar" is the minimum standard
you will accept from the People Analyzer results.
The power of setting the bar is
that you give all managers absolute clarity on what is acceptable and
what is not. Once
managers know your expectations, they will hold their people accountable
accordingly.

The recommended bar for a company with five core values is three
pluses, two plus/minuses, and never a minus.
This is strictly my recommendation
based on past experience. I have clients with higher and
lower bars, so you must decide for yourself.
The key point is that anyone who
is at or above the bar is the right person, and your goal is to get 100
percent of the right people in your
organization.

THE THREE-STRIKE RULE

What do you do if someone is below the bar?
Before you make any drastic
decisions, I highly recommend that you first communicate the People
Analyzer results to the person and give that person the chance to better
his or her performance. He or she will improve almost all
of the time. The question is, will he or she
improve enough to move above the bar? Most people will, some
won't, but you should give them a chance to perform according to the new
structure.

The three-strike rule works as follows:

      Strike
One: Discuss the issues and your
expectations with the person, and give him or her 30 days to correct the
problem.

      Strike
Two: If you don't see improvement,
discuss his or her performance again and give him or her another 30
days.

      Strike
Three: If you still don't see
improvement, he or she is not going to change and must go.
When the termination finally
happens, all of those who are the right people will thank you for it and
wonder what took you so long.

In practice, you will discover that you don't have to fire people most
of the time. Once you create an awareness of
your core values through your initial speech, quarterly
state-of-the-company meetings, the People Analyzer, performance reviews,
and the three-strike rule, the people that don't fit won't last until
the third strike. Some don't even last until the
first. Instead, they'll leave on their
own, because they know they don't fit.

What this process does is smoke them out. Consider the following
example: One leadership team had a member that was definitely not a fit.
He was the VP of sales and
marketing. In our first two sessions, I
watched him sweat through creating their Accountability Chart and squirm
through the process of discovering their core values.
It was becoming very clear why the
company's sales had stagnated for a few years.
By the third session, he begged
off, saying he had an important client meeting out of town and could not
attend. By the fourth session, he had quit
the company and taken another position. He was then replaced
with someone who was the right person in the right seat.
As a result, the client
experienced growth for the first time in three years.
This is a perfect example of how
someone can muddle through in an organization that lacks clarity over
roles, values, and expectations. When these tools are in place,
with increased focus and accountability, there is simply no place for
them to hide.

I recommend the four following steps to use with the People
Analyzer:

STEP 1

After discovering your core values as a leadership team,
"people-analyze" each other, as all EOS clients do.
This will accomplish two
objectives. First, it will validate your core
values. If you're all weak in one
particular value, you should question whether or not it truly should be
included. Second, you will see if someone on
the leadership team is below the bar. While this tough
situation does not come up often, you must follow the three-strike rule
with this person as well. Most of the time, this person will
improve his or her performance. Sometimes he or she will opt
out.

STEP 2

Have your leadership team people-analyze everyone in the organization
and then have each manager share those results in one-on-one sessions.
This will bring the tool to life
throughout the organization.

STEP 3

Use the People Analyzer in your quarterly performance reviews with all
team members. Let them analyze you as well.
Don't be afraid to put your money
where your mouth is.

STEP 4

If your leadership team is struggling with a personnel problem, run the
person through the People Analyzer. This will give you a
clear perspective on whether it's a right-person issue.
If it is, there is nothing more to
discuss and you now know how to solve it. If it isn't, and it
might be the person's seat, don't worry---we'll cover that
next.

RIGHT SEATS

Once you're confident you have selected the right people, it's
important to get them in the right seats. That means all of your
people are operating in their Unique
Abilities^®^ and those abilities
are clearly in line with their roles and
responsibilities.

A seat cannot be created until the organization is structured in the
right way so as to lift your company to the next level.
To create that structure, we'll
use a powerful tool called an Accountability Chart.
This is a supercharged
organizational chart, and, when completed, it will help owners and
leadership team members clearly grasp their own roles and
responsibilities. That will, in turn, enable them to
do the same for their people.

THE ACCOUNTABILITY CHART

This tool does not assume there is only one way to structure an
organization. You could read a hundred books on
organizational development and find a hundred
different
opinions on the way to structure an organization.
The key question is this: What is
the right structure to move your organization forward in the next six to
12 months?

Next to the V/TO, the Accountability Chart has the most impact of any
EOS tool. It forces its users to view their
organization in a different way and to address people issues that have
been holding them back for years.

For this exercise to have impact on your company, you'll need to
instill a few ground rules:

      1. You must look forward.
You cannot look back or get caught
up in the present. It will distort your
judgment.

      2. You must detach yourself from the
existing business, your current role, and your
ego.

      3. You must elevate yourself above
the business, look down on it, and make decisions for the long-term
greater good of the company.

The Accountability Chart starts with a fundamental belief that there
are only three major functions in any business and those three functions
make every organization run, regardless of whether it's a start-up
business or the largest company in the
world.

To illustrate the three major functions, picture three boxes side by
side by side. In the box to the left, you have
the first major function: sales and marketing.
In the middle box is the second:
operations. In the box to the right, you have
the third: finance and administration. You may call them by
different names, but those are the three major functions.
Sales and marketing generate
business. Operations provides the service or
manufactures the product, and takes care of the customer.
Finance and administration manage
the monies flowing in and out as well as the
infrastructure.

Assuming that three major functions exist in all organizations, the
next truth is that they must all be strong.

I've had many debates about whether sales and marketing is the most
important function. The argument is always that until
somebody sells something, nothing else happens.
That's hard to disagree with.
But realistically, all three have
to be strong.

To make the point, let's consider three
scenarios:

     • You have a strong sales and marketing function, a weak
operations function, and a strong financial function.
What's the net effect?
In that scenario, you're doing a
great job selling and bringing in new customers, but you're losing them
right out the back because operations is not delivering what you
promised and customers aren't happy.

     • You have a strong sales and marketing function, a strong
operations function, and a weak financial function.
What's the net effect?
Again, you'll bring in a lot of
customers and take good care of them, but money is coming in the front
door and going right out the back due to a lack of financial controls:
\$10 million in and \$10 million out, or worse, \$10 million in and
\$10.2 million out. This may strike a nerve because
many companies fall into a situation where there is no monitoring of
spending, nor is individual customer profitability
assessed.

     • You have a weak sales and marketing function, a strong
operations function, and a strong financial function.
What's the net effect?
A bunch of talented people in
operations and finance are waiting around for something to happen, and
nothing is.

If any of the three major functions are weak, your organization is not
as effective. Given that they are all equally
important, it's time to apply the Accountability Chart.
In order to maintain
accountability, only one person can ultimately be in charge of any major
function within an organization. Only one person oversees sales and
marketing, only one person runs operations, and only one person manages
finance and administration. When more than one person is
accountable, nobody is.

When leadership teams do this exercise for the first time, they often
discover they have two or even three names in a box.
This may happen with you as well.
If it does, you've uncovered a
root issue for your company's lack of growth or chaos, and you must
solve it by reducing the number of names to one.
The all-for-one and one-for-all
approach won't build a solid company. It may have gotten you
here, but only clear accountability will boost you to the next
level.

To take structure a step further, these three functions cannot operate
independently of each other. That's why all great organizations
have another major function, a role that I like to call the
integrator.

INTEGRATORS

The integrator is the person who harmoniously integrates the major
functions of the business. When those major functions are
strong and you have strong people accountable for each, great healthy
friction and tension will occur between them.
The integrator blends that
friction into greater energy for the company as a
whole.

I use the term "integrator" to cut through all the wonderful titles for
this role, such as CEO, president, general manager, king, or queen.
It doesn't matter what you call
it, but the bottom line is that the integrator is the person who has the
Unique Ability^®^ to run the
organization, manage day-to-day issues that arise, and integrate the
three major functions. The integrator is the glue that
holds the company together.

That is the basic structure of the Accountability Chart.
With that understanding, two other
very important factors need to be taken into account when creating the
right structure for your organization.

First of all, when customizing the Accountability Chart for your
company, the three major functions might split into more functions.
For example, sales and marketing
sometimes splits into a distinct sales function and a distinct marketing
function. Operations sometimes splits into
two or three distinct functions such as delivery, project management, or
customer service. Finance and administration can
split into as many as four: finance, administration, information
technology (IT), and human resources (HR).

Depending on the size and state of your organization, you will end up
with anywhere between three and ten major functions on that front line.
As long as you stay focused on
what the right structure is for your organization, the right number will
come. Please remember, though, less is
more. Not one EOS client has more than
seven major functions.

The second factor is another major function that is not on the front
line. In my experience, when a company
creates its Accountability Chart, half the time they
realize
that besides an integrator integrating the major functions, there's
another very powerful role in the organization.
This role shows up above the
integrator function, and it's called the
visionary.

VISIONARIES

The concept of the visionary within an Accountability Chart is one of
my greatest discoveries. I've had clients teach this
concept at universities to MBAs on my behalf.
Understanding and implementing
this concept is eye-opening and empowering.
Frankly, it has also kept some
partners from killing each other.

The visionary and the integrator couldn't be more different.
In a small to mid-size company,
the visionary is typically the owner, co-owner, or founder.
In a partnership, most of the
time, one partner is the visionary and the other is the integrator.
It's a dynamic that has elevated
them to where they are. The visionary typically has 10 new
ideas a week. Nine of them might not be so
great, but one usually is, and it's that one idea each week that keeps
the organization growing. For this reason, visionaries are
invaluable. They're typically very creative.
They're great solvers of big ugly
problems (not the little practical ones), and fantastic with important
clients, vendors, suppliers, and banking relationships.
The culture of the organization is
very important to them, because they usually operate more on emotion and
therefore have a better barometer of how people are feeling.
If you're one, know thyself and be
*free*.

By contrast, integrators are typically very good at leading, managing,
and holding people accountable. They love running the day-to-day
aspects of the business. They are accountable for profit
and loss, plus the overall business plan for the organization.
They remove obstacles so that
people running the major functions can execute.
They're great at special projects.
In sum, they operate more on
logic. If you are one, know thyself and
be *stressed*.

One University of California professor lectures that you always need
both an entrepreneur and a manager at the top of a company.
An entrepreneur's lust needs to be
counterbalanced with a manager's prudence and discipline.
He is making the same point as the
visionary/integrator relationship, just using different terminology.
When it's structured correctly,
the dynamic that exists between the two Unique
Abilities^®^ can be
magical.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For a deeper dive into the visionary/integrator dynamic, read
*Rocket Fuel: The One Essential
Combination That Will Get You More of What You Want from Your
Business.* Written with my co-author, Mark
C. Winters, it is a complete how-to
manual for finding, developing and maximizing your visionary/integrator
relationship.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Asphalt Specialists, Inc. (ASI), a paving company with
annual revenues of \$40 million and 120 employees, began The EOS
Process, their leadership team was dysfunctional and they had just
suffered their first ever unprofitable year.
The two owners, brothers Bruce and
Dan, were not seeing eye to eye. They were corunning the company,
and neither was in the right seat. Dan was entrenched in
all aspects of the business and quickly burning out, while Bruce was
selling full-time and becoming very frustrated with the state of
things.

The creation of their Accountability Chart led to an understanding of
the visionary and integrator roles. Through realizing their
true skill sets, the two brothers clearly defined their seats.
Bruce is now the visionary and Dan
is the integrator. With a clear vision, their
leadership team is now healthy and eager to accomplish their goal of
becoming the best-quality asphalt paving company in their market.
At a time when new construction in
the region was at a 20-year low and other competing asphalt companies
were struggling to stay in business, last year was their most profitable
ever.

My first experience with the power of the visionary/integrator roles
occurred in my very first company, Wickman Productions, which my dad and
I more or less co-ran. As a textbook visionary, he
quickly became frustrated with the day-to-day running of the business
but kept getting his hands into everything.
As a textbook integrator, I wanted
him to stay out of my way and let me handle the nuts and
bolts.

With frustrations building on both sides, I booked a conference room at
a Marriott hotel for the day. I prepared a presentation and
locked us in a room. I illustrated what the visionary
should do for the greater good of the organization, which was my dad's
Unique Ability^®^, and what the
integrator should do, which was mine. When all of the dust
settled, we were both clearly in our right seats, with clear roles and
responsibilities, motivated, and ready to go.
That was another key factor in
accomplishing the turnaround for the company.
Clear accountability will take you
to the next level.

It's common for a company to have a visionary but no integrator.
This causes a real struggle,
because the visionary is constantly frustrated with his or her lack of
traction. In addition, he or she has to keep
acting as the integrator and get pulled into the day-to-day management
of the business. For instance, Bob Shenefelt is
a pure
visionary. He built his first organization,
Great White, to \$10 million in revenue and then successfully sold it.
He made the
*Inc*.
500 fastest-growing companies
list, had a thriving culture, and---guess what?
He also had a partner who was an
integrator.

In his second company, RCS, he struggled to gain traction and grow past
\$4 million over a four-year period because he hadn't found the right
integrator. Last year, Bob brought on the
right integrator---Patrick Gysel---to fill the role.
RCS grew 40 percent, and this
year, it will achieve revenues of at least \$7 million with no end to
further growth in sight.

What makes the Accountability Chart more than just an organizational
chart is that once the major functions are clear, each is defined by
five major roles. As an example, the visionary
function's five roles might be as follows:

     • R&D/ideas

     • Creative problem-solving

     • Major relationships

     • Culture

     • Selling

The chart on the following page shows the most common examples of the
five major roles for each major function. Remember that about half
of all organizations have a visionary role, and the others don't.
This is represented by the dotted
line around the visionary.

LMA stands for *leading,
managing*, and holding people
*accountable*.
Anyone in the Accountability Chart
who has people reporting to him or her has a vital responsibility of
LMA. This requires time, energy, and
Unique Ability^®^.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For a deeper dive into LMA, read *How to Be a Great
Boss*. Written with my
co-author, René Boer, it is a complete guide for learning how to become
a world-class leader and manager.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You now map out your entire organization using the Accountability Chart
structure. Illustrate all of the functions in
your organization and which function they report to, and then list the
five major roles of that function. Determine if you have a
visionary in your organization. If you do, illustrate it
clearly.

As you construct your Accountability Chart, a few words of caution:
Create only the structure first. Don't put any names in any of the
boxes yet. In other words, illustrate the
correct functions at all levels in the organization.
This method will keep you honest
with yourself and lead you to the best structure.
Once the right structure is set,
then put the right people in the right seats.
When you choose someone for that
seat, you want to be certain that person is operating in his or her
Unique Ability^®^.

When you're finished, the Accountability Chart should look like an
organizational chart, with five bullets that illustrate the major roles
of each function. Important note: The Accountability
Chart will clarify function, role, and reporting structure, but it will
not define communication structure. Your communication
should flow freely across all lines and departments where necessary,
creating an open and honest culture. With each position's
accountability clear and communication crossing all departments, you
will avoid cross-departmental issues. The Accountability Chart
should in no way create silos or divisions.

YOUR LEADERSHIP TEAM

With the completion of your Accountability Chart, the visionary, if you
have one, the integrator, and the people heading up the major functions
will become your leadership team. You now have
representation and accountability for all the major functions of the
business. Now that your leadership team is
clearly in place, the next four chapters will address how you meet,
prioritize, communicate, report, solve issues, and execute your
vision.

GWC

Your completed Accountability Chart clarifies who is accountable for
what. With this level of clarity, it's
time to put all the right people into the right seats.
To do that you need only one
filter: GWC.

GWC stands for *get it, want
it*, and
*capacity* to do it.
GWC is a tool that stemmed from
thousands of hours of working with leaders.
The concept crystallized for me
while sitting in a coffee shop with a client.
We were discussing why one of his
moves, that of elevating one of his key people to the role of
integrator, hadn't yet borne fruit. He had the right person,
but the promotion hadn't worked. At that moment, the answer to a
question that had been bothering me clicked into place.
After hundreds of sessions, I
suddenly understood why filling seats hadn't worked for some.
I explained the concept of GWC to
him. As a result of the clarity GWC
gave him, he immediately realized he had made a wrong-seat mistake.
The person who got the job had
wanted it, but didn't have the capacity to do it.
That person was promptly removed
from the role and put in a more suitable position, where he now
excels.

The discovery came after observing many who'd been given seats but did
not step up and fully assume their roles. These people were not
fully performing because one of the three factors was absent.
They didn't get it, didn't want
it, or didn't have the capacity to do the
job.

To reach the next level, you need the people that report to you to be
able to take the ball and run with it. When you as their leader
or manager clearly articulate the seat (including roles,
responsibilities, expectations, and measurables) and present that
opportunity, you have created an opening. One of two things will
happen as a result: Either they will step up and take charge, or they
never will. If they
don't, it's because one of G, W, or C is missing.
In this scenario, you'll be
frustrated, they'll be frustrated, you'll never be able to delegate and
elevate, and you'll always be forced to do some or all of their work.
Let's break down these assets one
at a time.

Get It

You've seen people who get it and people who don't.
"Get it" simply means that they
truly understand their role, the culture, the systems, the pace, and how
the job comes together. Not everyone gets it.
The good news is that there are
plenty who do.

Want It

This means they genuinely like the job. They understand the
role, and they want to do it based on fair compensation and the
responsibility. In many instances, a manager feels
the need to motivate, overpay, or beg a person to want it, when the
reality is they don't. Sometimes their ego, your hopes,
or their ignorance about what the job entails will lead them to think
that they want it. But if they don't, they're never
going to provide that spark, no matter how effective a manager you are.
So stop beating your head against
the wall. Find someone who does want it, and
the difference will be immediately
apparent.

Capacity to Do It

Capacity means having the time as well as the mental, physical, and
emotional capacity to do a job well. Sometimes, a position
might require a commitment of 55 hours a week where the person is only
willing to commit 40. Sometimes the job requires a
certain level of intellect, skill, knowledge, and emotional
intelligence, and the person doesn't have that capacity.
This is the Peter Principle at its
finest, where people are elevated to a level of
incompetence.

A "no" on any of these three means it's not the right seat for the
person, it's not their Unique Ability^®^.
You must not fool yourself on this
point. You can occasionally turn a "no"
into a "yes" if you're willing to invest the time and money it takes to
elevate a person. However, in most cases, you won't
have the time to wait for them to adjust to the learning
curve.

Be careful not to assume you already have people to fill the major
functions. Just because they currently have
the job doesn't always mean that they get it, want it, and have the
capacity. Using the filter of GWC will keep
you honest with yourself.

When Ronnisch Construction Group, a general contractor with revenues of
\$44 million and 37 employees, started the process, Bernie Ronnisch, the
owner and integrator, had a leadership team of four.
As an unbiased party, I can tell
when someone is not going to cut it on the leadership team very early
on, usually well before the integrator sees it.
In this case, two out of the four
members were not going to make it---that's 50 percent of the team!
We struggled through the tasks of
setting quarterly priorities, creating the Accountability Chart, and
discovering core values, and then went through several quarters of poor
completion on achieving those priorities. In a fit of frustration,
I asked the two members directly how committed they were to this process
on a scale of 1 to 10. They both gave a
4.

That was all Bernie had to hear to make some tough changes.
Though both were very talented, he
removed them from the leadership team. One he let go, and the
other was moved to a superintendent role and shortly thereafter quit.
Bernie replaced them with the
right people in the right seats. Eighteen months later, the company
grew 50 percent in that calendar year. Once a solid leadership
team of five (Bernie added a major function) was firmly in place, they
went to work on the rest of the company. Painfully they turned
over 40 percent of their employees. As a result, they now
have the right people in the right seats organization-wide.
Four years after starting The EOS
Process, their growth of 70 percent last year put them seventh on the
*Crain's Detroit
Business* list of fastest-growing
companies. They were also a finalist for the
Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year
award.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I've been tracking a statistic over the last 11 years regarding my
client leadership team changes in their first two years of implementing
EOS. The data shows that 80 percent of
the time, there's a change in the leadership team as a result of this
process. This means that most of the time,
the leadership team that you start with is not the one you will end up
with. Half the time, the change is
removing someone from the team, and half the time, it's adding someone
to the team. The point is this: If you're truly
going to commit to building a great company, a strong leadership team,
and getting the right people in the right seats, you must prepare for
change on your leadership team. However, you may be one of the 20
percent in which there is no change.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Life is much easier for everyone when you have people around you who
genuinely get it, want it, and have the capacity to do
it.

With GWC now clear, incorporate it into your People Analyzer.
When you're evaluating your
people, the rating on GWC should be a black-and-white "yes" or "no,"
unlike the pluses and minuses for core values.
You must get a "yes" on all three,
or the person is in the wrong seat.

ONE NAME, TWO SEATS

You can have one name in two seats, just not two names in one seat.
When an organization first starts
out, the founding entrepreneur occupies every seat.
He or she is the one name in all
seats. He or she is the integrator, the
head of sales and marketing, the head of operations, and the head of
finance. As the organization grows, new
people are brought in to fill the seats needed.
For instance, once the
entrepreneur reaches capacity, he or she then brings in someone to run
operations and is able to let go of that major
function.

If you're at a point where you have people in more than one seat---for
instance, your bookkeeper is also your shipping person and your customer
service person---that is okay, as long they have enough time to do both
jobs well. It's a matter of the size of the
organization. If they or you don't have enough
time to be in all seats, that will have to change.
This leads us to the next
point.

DELEGATE AND ELEVATE

As your company grows, you have to rise to your Unique
Ability^®^, and the same goes for
your leadership team. With your Accountability Chart in
place, you can now determine when someone is working at full capacity.
Each person only has 100 percent
of his or her working time. This 100 percent represents the
amount of time each person is willing to work and still maintain
balance. For some people, it's 40 hours per
week, and for others, it's 70 hours. Everyone is
different.

When the amount of work requires more than 100 percent to do the job
well, say 120 percent, something has to give.
This person needs to delegate and
elevate the extra 20 percent because he or she is holding the
organization back and hitting the ceiling. In some cases, it's time
to move this person into one seat rather than the two he or she is
occupying right now. If this person is in one seat, he
or she needs to delegate more to other people, realize some efficiency,
or eliminate some tasks altogether. At all times, you want
to make sure that this person is drawing closer and closer to his or her
Unique Ability^®^.

For example, assume you have a great operations and a great finance
person in place, freeing you up from those major functions.
Yet your workload is still
requiring 120 percent of your time in order to lead and manage your
leadership team as the integrator, manage the sales team, sell, and
create marketing materials. It's time to let go of something
else. Assuming that leading and managing
the leadership team and selling are your Unique
Abilities^®^, you must delegate
managing the sales team and creating marketing materials to free up the
20 percent. Delegate to the right person in
the right seat and elevate yourself to your Unique
Ability^®^.

When you delegate and elevate, it's vital that you have the right
person in the right seat. If you don't, you'll never feel
completely comfortable letting go. You must also realize
that you have no choice but to delegate. If you're at 120
percent, you're holding the organization back and probably starting to
burn out. You no longer have the time to
fully run the company and manage the sales team well---never mind those
other jobs. If the only reason you're not
letting go is because of the person occupying the seat, it's time to
make that tough decision. You can't keep doing this person's
work for him or her. You can't keep taking on his or
her "monkeys," as Hal Burrows, William Oncken, Jr., and Kenneth
Blanchard illustrated so well in their book,
*The One Minute Manager Meets the
Monkey*.

Envision all of your direct reports' responsibilities, problems, and
issues as monkeys. When your direct report walks into
your office with a problem, he or she is trying to leave his or her
monkey with you. At the end of the day, after
multiple people have walked into your office with their problems and
left them with you, you end up with 20 monkeys jumping around your
office. If someone walks in with a monkey,
he or she needs to walk out with it. If he or she can't or
won't, you've hired the wrong person.

Tyler Smith of Niche Retail is a textbook example of someone who has
been able to constantly delegate and elevate as his organization has
grown and continuously broken through new ceilings.
When Tyler and his partner, Brad
Sorock, started their Internet retail company (with Tyler as integrator
and Brad as visionary), Tyler handled all sales, operations, and
finance, while Brad was in the lab researching and finding the next
product idea and strategy. Tyler would get a ping on his cell
phone indicating he had received an order, and he would go down to his
basement and print the order, package it, and ship it out.
He would then process the payment,
order from his supplier, and pay the bills.
This went on for the first
year.

As the business grew, he reached full capacity.
He couldn't do all of his former
jobs anymore. His first delegation and elevation
was to his wife, Stacey, who helped him pack boxes.
Soon, they reached capacity again.
He hired someone to help him ship
orders, and he let go of that function completely.
He then moved to a
2,000-square-foot warehouse that could handle all of the inventory,
which created the need for an operations manager.
He then hired a bookkeeper and let
go of that function. The growth
continued.

Niche moved to a 10,000-square-foot warehouse.
That created the need for a CFO
and then a COO, as well as a head of site stores and marketing.
Further growth required an
80,000-square-foot warehouse, and the story continues to this day.
Tyler masterfully delegated and
elevated each time he reached capacity, avoiding burnout.
In addition, each member of the
leadership team continues to delegate and elevate as the organization
continues to grow. Here is Niche Retail's evolving
Accountability Chart:

EVOLUTION

As your organization grows, your Accountability Chart will constantly
evolve and change, as you can see in the example on the preceding pages
featuring Niche Retail. This is a dynamic tool.
Think back to what your structure
looked like when you were half your size. Now imagine what it
would look like at double the size. What are the
differences? The point is that the
Accountability Chart is an ever-evolving tool if you're growing.
At a growth rate of 20 percent,
you will make a change to the Accountability Chart about every 90
days.

SCALABILITY

When you build out your Accountability Chart, you will notice that
certain functions require multiple people doing the same job (e.g.,
salespeople, customer service representatives, accounting clerks).
The Accountability Chart becomes
scalable. Where multiple people have the
same job, you simply put the number of people in that function rather
than adding multiple new boxes.

For example, if you look at Niche Retail's Year 5 Accountability Chart
under the call center manager, you'll see the customer service
representative (CSR) function with eight people in
it.

YOUR EXISTING ORGANIZATIONAL CHART

You may be wondering what to do with your existing organizational
chart. Your newly created Accountability
Chart should replace it and become the tool you use to illustrate the
organizational structure. It clearly shows the reporting
structure and the roles and responsibilities of each function.
Keep it simple.
The next step is to share it with
everyone in your company. They'll appreciate knowing where
they fit and what they are accountable for.

From there, assuming they have your core values and GWC, let go of the
vine and let them execute. You will experience the incredible
results that come from harnessing all of their combined
talents.

TERMINATIONS

A word of caution: Now that you've created clarity, you'll clearly see
the people that do not fit in the organization.
Yet you shouldn't run out and fire
them all. That would make you vulnerable as
an organization and leave some gaping
holes.

Take a methodical approach to personnel changes, making sure that
everyone on the leadership team is on the same page and then moving
forward step by step. This doesn't give you an out.
It just means that you can't put
the company in a vulnerable position. You still have to make
the change.

Once, my parents went out of town at a time when my two teenage
brothers and I still lived at home. Upon their return, my
dad realized we hadn't watered my mom's plant and it was quickly dying.
We decided that overwatering it
would do the trick, and of course it didn't.
Upon noticing the problem, my mom
simply grabbed a pair of scissors and pruned a few dying limbs.
The plant came back to life a
short time later.

You must do a little pruning from time to time for the organization to
flourish. Merely hoping that poorly fitting
people will make it, sending them to a seminar, or giving them a pep
talk is like overwatering the plant. It isn't going to solve
the problem. Once you do the necessary pruning,
your organization will be revitalized.

36 HOURS OF PAIN

If people must go, and you're procrastinating because the prospect of
firing them seems painful, hopefully this will give you some motivation.
During the evolution of Niche
Retail illustrated on the previous pages, Tyler Smith kept someone
around for a year too long because he was having a really hard time
making the decision to let the person go. What made it equally
tough was this person had been with them through the early years.
The company outgrew him, though.
He was aware of this, and over
time, his attitude had soured. The leadership team finally pulled
out the People Analyzer and the results showed there was simply no other
option. The person was no longer right for
the organization. As a result, after much anguish
and soul-searching Tyler finally made the tough decision to let him go.
A couple of days later, Tyler
called me and shared a term that is now an EOS staple: 36 hours of
pain.

The hours leading up to and including the termination were painful, but
after that point, he realized it was one of the best decisions he had
made for the greater good of the company. He couldn't understand
why he hadn't done it sooner. The work environment was so much
better and less tense for everyone. He was
relieved.

Other employees thanked him for making the tough decision.
He experienced all that pain for a
year, when in hindsight he could have experienced only 36 hours of pain,
probably for both parties. Incidentally, the terminated
gentleman is now doing well and pursuing his passion.
The decision was best for
all.

If the People Analyzer shows you that someone is the wrong person for
your organization, make the decision. And yes, there will be
some pain, but only for about 36 hours.

Keep two important points in mind:

      1. Be careful what you wish for
because you'll get it. If you want to grow, you have to
understand that not everyone is going to be able to keep up and remain
in the same seat forever.

      2. Keeping people around just because
you like them is destructive. You're doing a disservice to the
company, to everyone in it, and to the person.
People must add value.
I realize this may sound cold, but
to the degree people are in the right seats, everyone is happier,
especially them.

THE THREE QUESTIONS TO ASK

When a client completes its Accountability Chart, we ask three
questions to confirm that it is at 100 percent.
Please ask these three questions
with your leadership team:

      1. Is this the right structure to get
us to the next level?

      2. Are all of the right people in the
right seats?

      3. Does everyone have enough time to
do the job well?

A "yes" on all three confirms that you're at 100 percent in this
essential component.

We now know what great leaders mean when they attribute their success
to surrounding themselves with good people.
It's putting the right people
(core values) in the right seats (GWC and Unique
Ability^®^).

With your vision clear and shared by all, and with the right people in
the right seats, the next step is measuring your progress and having an
absolute pulse on your business. That requires the use of
data.
