# Chapter 7: The Process Component

CHAPTER 7

THE
PROCESS COMPONENT

FINDING YOUR *WAY*

When Jim Weichert, the
founder of Weichert, Realtors, one of the largest real estate companies
in the world with over 19,000 salespeople and over 500 offices, was
asked the secret of his success, he gave a one-word answer: consistency.
That means consistency works.
Consistency allows him to scale
his business. As a result, he has built a solid
organization that has endured for almost four
decades.

Nothing can be fine-tuned until it's first consistent.
The Process Component is
strengthened through your understanding of the handful of core processes
(on average, about seven) that make up your unique business model.
You then have to make sure that
everyone in your organization understands them, values them, and follows
them. This component is the most
neglected one, often taken for granted and undervalued by entrepreneurs
and leaders. Yet the successful ones see what
process can do for them. By not giving this component your
full attention, it's costing you money, time, efficiency, and
control.

Imagine once again that you could rise above and look down on your
organization. How would it look?
What are all of the moving parts?
You should take this high-level
view from time to time and appreciate what you have.
Sometimes you can take what's been
built for granted. To paraphrase philosopher and
logician Kurt Gödel, you can't be in a system while at the same time
understanding the system you're in. In other words, you need
to raise your head from time to time and see the system for what it is,
whether it's good or bad. We are normally so buried in the
day-to-day scramble that we never take the time to do this.
Yet, you'll see something new
every time you do.

A typical organization operates through a handful of core processes.
How these processes work together
is its unique system. To break through the ceiling and
build a well-oiled machine, you need to possess the ability to
systemize. That is what this chapter is all
about: helping you systemize what you've built.
You'll discover different ways to
improve upon your processes, simplify them, apply technology to them,
and, most important of all, make them consistent throughout your
organization.

Michael Gerber, author of *The
E-Myth* and *The E-Myth
Revisited*, calls this your franchise
prototype. To the degree you can clarify your
systems and hone them, you will run your business as opposed to having
your business run you. The culmination of identifying,
documenting, and having everyone follow the core processes of your
business is your *Way*.
When you have a clear
*Way*, you immediately
increase the value of your business, strengthen your control over it,
and give yourself options. From there, you may grow the
business, let someone else run it, sell it, or simply take more time
off.

Countless business owners complain about their lack of control or
freedom and yet, in the same breath, discount the value of process.
It's like the story of the dog
sitting on a nail. A gentleman walks up to a
farmhouse. On the porch is an old man sitting
in his rocking chair, and next to him is his old dog.
The old dog is moaning, so the
gentleman asks the old man why. "It's because he's sitting on a
nail," the old man replies. "Why doesn't he move?"
asks the gentleman.
"Because it's not hurting enough
for him to move."

Those business owners complaining about lack of control and freedom
need to get off the nail and work on systemizing their businesses.
In many organizations, people do
their jobs however they want, resulting in tremendous inefficiencies and
inconsistencies being embedded in the system.
If they really saw all the
variations, most business owners would be shocked.
Many of them are just plain afraid
to uncover what's really going on. They cross their fingers
and hope that the company will keep chugging
along.

A good example of a company that gained the power of the Process
Component is Franklin Communities. It owns and manages
eight manufactured-home communities.
Despite being in a stereotyped
business, owners Ron and Andy Blank have broken the mold.
They run a tight ship.
They implement every EOS tool to
the letter. With the help of an amazing and
tenacious operations person, Shelley Taylor, they created their Way and
ran with it. With the help of a strong sales
team led by Larry Lawson, each of the eight managers runs his or her
communities by the book. The result is an occupancy rate
that has the competition scratching their heads.
While the industry's occupancies
are dropping, Franklin's have steadily increased over the last four
years.

To systemize your organization through your core processes, you must
take two major steps. First, you have to document the
core processes. Second, you have to ensure that
they are followed by all. Let's start with
documenting.

DOCUMENTING YOUR CORE PROCESSES

There are three stages in documenting your *Way*.
First, identify your core
processes. Then break down what happens in
each one and document it. Finally, compile the information
into a single package for everyone in your
company.

IDENTIFY YOUR CORE PROCESSES

To start off, schedule an hour with your leadership team.
This is not an assignment to
delegate to one person. Take this initial step together so
that you're calling your core processes the same thing.
Entrepreneurs tend to claim
they
already know what the processes are; I frequently get resistance on the
need to call this meeting at all. Every time I suggest it, the
reaction is, "Oh, we can do that in five minutes."
I've yet to see a team do it in
less than an hour.

Here's why. Your leadership team needs to
identify and *agree* on what to call your
core processes. Once you start the discussion,
you're going to find you have different names for them and lack
consensus on how many there are.

Your core processes typically include the
following:

      The HR
process is the way you search, find,
hire, orient, manage, review, promote, retain, and fire
people.

      The marketing
process is the way you get your message
to your target audience and generate interest in what you do and
prospects for your salespeople.

      The sales
process is the way you convert a
prospect into a customer.

      The operations
processes are the way you make your
product or provide your service to your customer.
There are typically one to three
core processes within operations (e.g., project management, logistics,
warehouse, distribution, service technicians, account management,
service delivery, production, quality control, customer
service).

      The accounting
process is the flow and management of
all monies coming in and going out.

      The customer-retention
process is the proactive way that you
take care of your customers after your product or service has been
delivered and the way you retain customers so that they continue to come
back and send you referrals.

No matter how many core processes you have, you need to identify the
ones that address every activity going on in the business.
Then list them in one document and
make sure that your leadership team is 100 percent on the same page with
the amount, the names, and what they are.

It's surprising how productive this step is.
The exercise creates clarity of
thought that is then put down in black and white.
You will find it to be worth every
minute of the hour you spend. You will realize a return on the
time invested quickly as a result of everyone immediately speaking the
same language.

Now that you've identified each core process and have a name for each
one, everyone must call each of them by the exact same name from this
day forward. If the way you manage your
accounts is called the Customer Care Process, everyone must call it
that. Just by calling your core
processes by consistent names, you reduce complexity and increase
efficiency in the organization.

DOCUMENT EACH OF THE CORE PROCESSES

In this step, the Accountability Chart comes into play.
The person that is accountable for
a certain process takes charge of documenting it.
The head of sales and marketing
takes the sales process and the marketing process.
The head of operations takes the
one to three operations processes, and so on.
The integrator usually owns the
entire project, making sure everyone is clear and on
track.

To avoid wasting time, make sure you've completed the first step of
identifying your core processes before you start documenting.
A single example will show why.
One client skipped Step 1 and went
ahead and documented all the procedures in the organization.
When the client was done, it had
100 separate procedures documented on its intranet.
This work was not a total waste,
but once the client went back to Step 1 and agreed on its seven core
processes, each of the 100 procedures suddenly took on meaning because
it became a part of one of their seven core processes.
The client found that the
procedures were much better organized, and could be transferred to all
of its 120 employees. Still, it would have saved a lot
of time and effort to identify the core processes
first.

When documenting the processes, you should follow the 20/80 rule.
That means document the 20 percent
that produces 80 percent of the results. In other words, document
at a very high level. You should not be creating a
500-page document. The 20/80 rule gives you the
highest return on
your time invested. The trap many organizations fall
into is wasting valuable time trying to document 100 percent of
everything. If you document 100 percent of a
core process, it might take 30 pages. If you document the most
important 20 percent, you should need around six
pages.

A similar common problem is trying to document every single little
detail down to the nth degree. This is overkill.
You just need to capture the basic
steps in the process, because the real problem is that people are
skipping steps, and not always on purpose. Festering problems then
blow up weeks or months down the road. In the heat of the
uproar, you treat the symptom and not the root cause, which was that
someone skipped a step. There is always an uncomfortable
laugh when I share this truth. You need to document the steps in
the process at a very high level, with several bullets under each step,
which are procedures. This way, you can make sure
everyone is following the process.

What you're illustrating are the basic guideposts to helping your
people become consistent and efficient in your organization.
The following is an example of a
documented process:

THE HR PROCESS

Step 1: The Search

     • Define role/job description/salary (the
seat)

     • Decide search medium

     • Begin search

     • E-mail 20 sphere/peers

Step 2: Interviewing

     • Screen résumés

     • Initial interview/profiling tools

     • Second interview

     • Check references

     • CEO interview/core values speech

Step 3: Hiring

     • Eight-hour on-the-job trial

     • Decision

     • 90-day trial

Step 4: Orientation

     • HR policy/review employee manual

     • Benefits review/forms

     • Position training

     • CEO orientation (company
story/culture)

Step 5: Quarterly Reviews

     • Manager fills out the People Analyzer in preparation for the
review

     • Follow the review checklist

     • Review the People Analyzer

     • Document the review and have it signed by all
parties

     • File review with HR department

Step 6: Termination

     • Three-strike rule with documentation

     • Terminate upon third strike

     • Contact legal counsel

     • Meet with employee/have HR present

     • Exit interview

     • Document termination and have it signed by all
parties

Step 7: Ongoing Benefits Management

     • 401K management

     • Bonus plan

     • Health insurance

     • Employee files

In the end, each core process will run between two and 10 pages.
Operations processes are usually
the longest. Don't be totally constricted by
the 20/80 rule. Include whatever you feel is
necessary. Just make sure you keep it
simple.

Once you start to document, you're going to uncover some hidden bones.
Some steps will be in place that
don't have to be. You won't understand how the heck
they ever got there in the first place. When you ask why, you'll
hear responses such as, "Well, we've always done it that
way."

A man was once with his wife's family for Thanksgiving.
During the preparation of the
meal, he observed his wife cutting the back of a ham off before putting
it in the oven. Curious, he asked her why she cut
the back off the ham. She responded, "It's tradition.
It's the way we've always done it
in our family." Her mother had just arrived, so he
took the opportunity to go over and ask why they cut off the back of a
ham. She said, "It's tradition.
It's the way we've always done
it." Fortunately, his wife's
grandmother was there as well, so he went to her and asked the same
question. She replied, "Once upon a time,
the pan was too small, and it was the only way to get the ham to fit in
the pan."

Your people doing things because they've always done them that way is
not good enough. With the opportunity to build a
well-oiled machine, you must now be able to show them a better
way.

As you simplify, most of the time you will find that your core
processes are too complex. By documenting the process, you
will find many opportunities to dumb them down by eliminating redundant
steps, taking out any confusion and any complexity.
The goal is to
streamline.

Eliminate steps, condense steps, and put checklists in place where
possible. Some steps in your processes will
easily be converted to checklists that can be used on the floor or in
the field. You should make your processes
bulletproof so that no one can screw them
up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Checklists have been an extremely effective tool for my clients to
create consistency, quality control, and repeatable results.
Please consider this heavily when
documenting your core processes. There's a reason pilots and health
care professionals use them. Countless studies have shown the
considerable difference between using them or not.
Use them for proposals, events,
project management, and account management, to name a
few.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another advantage of simplifying each of the processes is to discover
where technology can be applied. To connect core processes, or to
enhance them on their own, realizes efficiencies and increases your
profitability. There are great software systems
that can connect your core processes and eliminate redundant steps, but
make sure the investment of time and money will actually produce a
return. Don't implement technology for
technology's sake, leading to unnecessary
headaches.

In my previous business, I made a move that I call the \$45,000
Mistake. We needed a technology to manage
The List that was created from our target market, as covered in
Chapter
3.
We kept a tremendous amount of
information and history on our clients and prospects.
We also needed to tie all of our
North American trainers together.

I engaged an organization that claimed to have the latest and greatest
technology. They were going to create the
ideal software for us from scratch. This software would
connect sales, marketing, and operations. After months and months
of work and \$45,000 spent creating the software, we scrapped it.
Instead, we used a simple \$500
off-the-shelf product that did everything we needed.
The mistake I made was in not
taking a close look at the process and the market for software.
I got too caught up in the sizzle
of what that particular software company was
promising.

Technology must improve your *Way*.
That means you must research and
then decide based on creating efficiencies and simplification, not
hype.

The other reason you must document and simplify your processes is that
your business has to become self-sustaining.
It has to be able to run without
you. You have to get your key processes
out of your head and onto paper. God forbid something happens to
you or any of your people. If one of you disappeared
tomorrow, could someone step in and pick up right where you left off?
They should be able to, and by
doing this step, you'll ensure that they
can.

PACKAGE IT

Good news! Now that your core processes are
documented, Step 3 is the easiest of all. Here's where you take
all of the great work you've done in Steps 1 and
2 and
package it. The titles of your core processes
now become your table of contents. Each documented process
in Step 2 becomes one of your sections. You put them in a binder
or on your company intranet. On the cover, put your company
name followed by the word "Way." If your company name is the ABC
Company, then it should read "The ABC Company
Way."

Your *Way* is now ready to use
for reference and training. That's when the real magic
happens. Now, everyone in the company can
be trained to follow the correct process. This happened at an
upscale pub and billiards restaurant called Roosevelt's.
After co-owner Bill Gitre got his
team in place, they went to work on documenting and simplifying their
Way. The business model has become
successful enough that they are now opening a second
location.

FOLLOWED BY ALL

When everyone follows their process, it's much easier for managers to
manage, troubleshoot, identify and solve issues, and therefore grow the
business. The clear lines of process enable
you to let go and gain more control. Your business now
becomes more scalable, which means that you can add more customers,
transactions, revenue, and employees while reducing
complexity.

In order to implement this crucial step, your leadership team must be
convinced that everyone should follow one system.
To convince your people to follow
the process, your leadership team needs to be committed to managing all
of the people to make the adjustment. If you are all
committed, it will work. If you're not, it won't.
"Do as I say, not as I do" is not
effective management. I say this because most of the
time this
step fails because the owner or owners are not willing to follow the
process.

Assuming you're convinced, the following step requires you to convince
your people. You have to consider their point
of view. If you didn't see the value in
following a process before, how can you expect your people to see the
value now? What you need to show is how the
new system will create efficiencies to make their lives easier and the
company more successful. They need to understand how the
processes tie together into a complete
system.

You shouldn't expect them to put you on their shoulders and carry you
out of the room cheering, but do expect them to follow their assigned
processes. While this isn't quite like
announcing a company-wide 25 percent raise, you should present it with
the same enthusiasm. If you have the right people in
the right seats, they will see the value, appreciate it, and benefit
from it.

One of the best ways to convince them is by creating a clear visual of
what your *Way* looks like.
Business processes are often
intangible and therefore tough for people to understand.
To the degree that you can
illustrate what it looks like, you will accomplish this
objective.

Sachse Construction came up with a great illustration.
Owner Todd Sachse created a model
of how all of the processes worked together in his organization.
When he did his presentation on
the importance of everyone following a process, his visual showed how
every time a person follows a step in the process, it affects others.
He called it the Circle of Life.
Just as in nature, everyone in the
organization depends on each other to thrive.
By everyone following their
process, everyone's life is ultimately going to be better.
The opposite holds true as well.
When someone doesn't follow the
process, it has a negative effect on others in the organization.
This knowledge actually motivates
his people to work together and help make each process better.
As a result, all processes in his
Way are understood, embraced, and followed by everyone in his
organization.

"FOLLOWED BY ALL" ACTION STEPS

      1. Create your Circle of Life
visual.

      2. Schedule a company meeting to
share your *Way* or share it at your
next quarterly company meeting.

      3. Retrain
everyone.

      4. Manage your people to follow the
processes.

With your business systemized, you can better troubleshoot when
problems arise, since many of them result from process-related issues.
For instance, maybe there's an
invoice that didn't go out due to the customer service representative
not forwarding a copy of the order form to accounting.
Track the problem to the source
and solve it. When a problem occurs, you can go
right to the step that is not working and alter or eliminate it.
In some cases, you may add a new
step. But you're simply performing
maintenance at this point. You now have everything you need
to get your *Way* followed by
all.

Strengthening the Process Component will give you more control.
You will have options with your
business: to grow it, step away from it, sell it, maintain it, franchise
it, or duplicate it in another city. Whichever option you
choose, your organization's value has increased.
Your organization will be worth
more as a result. This is what people that purchase
businesses are looking for: a turnkey system.
For instance, the owners of Image
One were approached by a billion-dollar publicly traded company in the
same industry and eventually sold to them. The president of the
division at the time, who previously worked for Jack Welch at GE, said
that Image One was one of the best-run companies he'd ever
seen.

With the mastery of the Process Component, you're closing in on
achieving your destination.

You're now ready to bring it all down to the ground with the final
piece of the puzzle---the Traction
Component.
