# Chapter 1: The Entrepreneurial Operating System

CHAPTER 1

THE ENTREPRENEURIAL
OPERATING SYSTEM

STRENGTHENING THE SIX KEY COMPONENTS

Every great system is
made up of a core group of basic components. The same applies to a
business. The Entrepreneurial Operating
System (EOS) identifies Six Key Components of any organization.
In the words of an EOS client, "I
used to worry about 100 different things. Once I learned there
were six components to my business and I focused on only those, those
100 different things I'd been worrying about went away.
EOS made running the business
simpler."

You're probably worrying needlessly about a hundred different things
yourself. Let's try to remove you from some
of those worries by taking a wide-angle view of your business and its
components. Below are the Six Key Components
of any organization.

VISION

Successful business owners not only have compelling visions for their
organizations, but also know how to communicate those visions to the
people around them. They get everyone in the
organization seeing the same clear image of where the business is going
and how it's going to get there. It sounds easy, but it's
not.

Are your staff all rowing in the same direction?
Chances are they're not.
Some are rowing to the right, some
are rowing to the left, and some probably aren't rowing at all.
If you met individually with each
of your employees and asked them what the company's vision was, you'd
likely get a range of different answers.

The more clearly everyone can see your vision, the likelier you are to
achieve it. Focus everyone's energy toward one
thing and amazing results will follow. In his book
*Focus*, Al Ries illustrates
the point in this way: The sun provides the earth with billions of
kilowatts of energy, yet if you stand in it for an hour, the worst you
will get is a little sunburn. On the other hand, a few watts of
energy focused in one direction is all a laser beam needs to cut through
diamonds.

In the Vision Component chapter, you will use a tool called The
Vision/Traction Organizer (V/TO) to focus your people on one target and
become like that laser beam. The tool simplifies strategic
planning by distilling your vision into simple points that allow you to
clearly define who you are as an organization, where you're going and
how you'll get there. It will help you define your sweet
spot as an organization and keep you focused on the areas in which you
excel most. It will also define your marketing
strategy and crystallize your 10-year target, three-year picture, and
one-year plan. In addition, you'll learn to
effectively convey your vision to your staff and ensure that it's
embraced by everyone.

PEOPLE

Successful leaders surround themselves with great people.
You can't build a great company
without help. EOS cuts through buzzwords such as
"A players," "platinum," "100 percenters," and "superstars" to provide a
practical understanding of the two essential ingredients of any great
team: the *right
people* in the
*right
seats*.

Be truly honest with yourself. Are all of your people the right
ones for their jobs? The reality is that some are
probably hurting your cause more than helping.
The People Analyzer tool in
Chapter
4 will help
identify the right people by teaching you how to determine who shares
your core values. It will also teach you to simplify
how you hire, fire, review, reward, and recognize people in your
organization.

This process will prompt you to step back and look at your overall
structure. You'll ask yourself hard questions
about the way your business is organized. You'll also learn the
power of the Accountability Chart, as well as how to structure your
company the
right way while clearly defining the roles and responsibilities within
your organization.

Once you have the right structure in place, you'll be able to focus on
putting the right people in the right seats.
There will be no gray area when
you incorporate the next tool, GWC, which addresses the three absolutes
for any good hire. They must
*get it, want
it*, and have the
*capacity* to do it.
Once you incorporate GWC into The
People Analyzer, you'll have a working tool that determines which people
are the right ones and which people are in the right
seats.

DATA

The best leaders rely on a handful of metrics to help manage their
businesses. The Data Component frees you from
the quagmire of managing personalities, egos, subjective issues,
emotions, and intangibles by teaching you which metrics to focus
on.

My business mentor, Sam Cupp, owned several companies totaling over
\$300 million in sales, including QEK Global Solutions, a worldwide
fleet management company that he built into a \$100-million business and
then sold. He is one of the best businessmen
I've ever met. I was blessed to have him take me
under his wing at a young age and teach me everything he knew.
Of all of that wisdom, the most
useful thing he taught me was the power of managing my business through
a Scorecard.

A Scorecard is a weekly report containing five to 15 high-level numbers
for the organization. In the Data Component chapter, you
will learn to create and implement this powerful tool into your company.
It will enable you to have a pulse
of your business on a weekly basis, predict future developments, and
quickly identify when things have fallen off the track.
Because you're regularly reviewing
the numbers, you'll be able to quickly spot and solve problems as they
come up as opposed to reacting to bad numbers in a financial statement
long after the fact.

A Scorecard allows you to monitor your business no matter where you
are. You won't have to suffer from the
uneasy feeling of not quite knowing what's going
on in your
business, nor will you have to waste time asking a half dozen people for
the real story. The answers will be right at your
fingertips.

In addition to learning to create and implement your Scorecard, you
will take your data management to the next level by learning to empower
each person in your organization. Everyone will have a clear,
meaningful, and manageable number that he or she is accountable for on a
regular basis.

ISSUES

Issues are the obstacles that must be faced to execute your vision.
Just as an individual's success is
directly proportionate to his or her ability to solve any issues that
arise, the same holds true for a company.

One helpful by-product of strengthening the first three EOS components
is transparency. Execute them properly and you will
have created an open organization where there is nowhere to hide.
As a result, you will smoke out
issues that have been holding you back.

The good news is that, in the history of business, there has only ever
been a handful of different kinds of issues.
The same ones come up over and
over again. In time, you will become an expert
at identifying them and knocking them down. To the degree you can
identify them, discuss them honestly in a healthy environment, and learn
to eradicate them, you will achieve your
vision.

Regardless of how long you've been plagued by your problems, the Issues
Component represents a huge opportunity. In the bustle of
day-to-day operations, most companies don't invest the time required to
adequately solve their issues. The irony is that by taking the
time to address a problem, you will save two to 10 times that amount of
time in the future.

In the Issues Component chapter, you will learn how to use the Issues
List at all levels in your organization, allowing you to
compartmentalize and prioritize all issues. In addition, you'll
benefit by creating an open and honest culture where people feel safe to
speak the truth and voice their concerns. You will then use the
Issues Solving Track to eradicate these issues.
This powerful tool is an efficient
way to
identify, discuss, and solve your organizational issues in a lasting and
meaningful way.

By the end of the Issues Component chapter, you and your staff should
understand how to identify various issues, create and manage an Issues
List, and master the Issues Solving Track, taking you one step closer to
building a problem-solving work environment.

PROCESS

Your processes are your *Way* of doing business.
Successful organizations see their
*Way* clearly and constantly
refine it. Due to lack of knowledge, this
secret ingredient in business is the most neglected of the Six Key
Components. Most entrepreneurs don't
understand how powerful process can be, but when you apply it correctly,
it works like magic, resulting in simplicity, scalability, efficiency,
and profitability.

You will not get your company to the next level by keeping your
processes in your head and winging it as you go.
Ask yourself: Have you documented
the way you want everything done in your organization?
Do your people know what processes
they are following and why? Are they all executing the
required procedures uniformly? Are they skipping steps?
By deciding what the process is
and training everyone to follow it, you will enhance your
troubleshooting abilities, reduce your errors, improve efficiency, and
increase your bottom line.

In the Process Component chapter, we will identify, address, and
document each of your core processes using the Three-Step Process
Documenter. This tool will help you
crystallize your business model by capturing the blueprint for the
machine you aspire to build in a single document.
From there, you will learn how to
get your staff to understand the value of these processes and begin to
follow them.

By the end of the journey, your processes will be clearly identified,
documented, understood, and followed by everyone in your
organization.

TRACTION

In the end, the most successful business leaders are the ones with
traction. They execute well, and they know
how to bring focus, accountability, and discipline to their
organization.

Due to fear and lack of discipline, the Traction Component is typically
most organizations' weakest link. The inability to make a business
vision a reality is epidemic. Consider it a new take on an old
quote: Vision without traction is merely hallucination.
All over the world, business
consultants frequently conduct multiple-day strategic planning sessions
and charge tens of thousands of dollars for teaching what is
theoretically great material. The downside is that after making
you feel warm and fuzzy about your direction, these same consultants
rarely teach how to bring your vision down to the ground and make it
work in the real world.

How would you rate the accountability throughout your organization on a
scale of 1 to 10? Most new clients that start The
EOS Process rate their accountability somewhere around 4.
Gaining traction requires two
disciplines. First, everyone in the
organization should have Rocks, which are clear 90-day priorities
designed to keep them focused on what is most important.
The second discipline requires
implementing what is called a Meeting Pulse at all levels in the
organization, which will keep everyone focused, aligned, and in
communication.

In the Traction Component chapter, you will first learn how to set
Rocks so that everyone will know what they are accountable for in the
coming 90 days. Next, you'll learn how to
implement a Meeting Pulse. While most people feel that
meetings are a waste of time, they are necessary and useful tools.
As part of the component, you'll
learn how to make meetings enjoyable, productive, and worthwhile.
The Level 10 Meeting Agenda is a
tool that will help you get to the core of what makes for great
meetings, namely conflict and resolution.

By the end of Chapter
8, everyone in
your organization should know how to establish and achieve their Rocks.
They'll also be engaging in
effective, productive meetings using the tried and true Level 10 Meeting
Agenda.

Now that we know what the Six Key Components are, we need to assess
where your company is right now. The Organizational Checkup at the
end of this chapter will tell you exactly where you are on this path.
You can also fill out the
questionnaire online at [www.eosworldwide.com](http://www.eosworldwide.com)
/checkup. Several of the terms
won't be clear to you yet, but in a short time you'll know exactly what
they mean. Fill out the questionnaire and use
the attached key to get your results.

You'll be coming back to this checkup on a routine basis.
The goal is to make progress every
90 days. Each time you fill out the
checkup, your overall percentage should increase.
It's unreasonable to think that
you'll jump from 20 percent to 80 percent overnight, but you will make
steady progress.

In summary, successful businesses operate with a crystal clear vision
that is shared by everyone. They have the right people in the
right seats. They have a pulse on their
operations by watching and managing a handful of numbers on a weekly
basis. They identify and solve issues
promptly in an open and honest environment. They document their
processes and ensure that they are followed by everyone.
They establish priorities for each
employee and ensure that a high level of trust, communication, and
accountability exists on each team.

The Six Key Components together make up The EOS Model.
Most organizations operate below
50 percent. If they succeed, it's in spite of
themselves. Although it's nearly impossible to
reach 100 percent in every component, achieving over 80 percent will
turn your company into a well-oiled machine.
All the things you've been
worrying about will simply fall into place, and the common frustrations
that have been plaguing you will go away.

Now that the big picture is clear, let's begin the journey.
But before we dive headfirst into
the nuts and bolts of the first component, you'll have to free yourself
from the bad habits and unhealthy practices that are holding you back.
This is called letting go of the
vine.
