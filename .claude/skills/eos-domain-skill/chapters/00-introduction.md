# INTRODUCTION

Humor me for a moment and mentally detach yourself from your day-to-day
details. Forget all your pre-existing
beliefs about how to run your organization.
Now imagine a bird's-eye view of
your business and look down on it from above.
What do you
see?

You're reading this book because you want your organization to be solid
and well-run. You've already achieved a certain
degree of success, and now you're ready for the next level.
However, with this challenge comes
a new set of obstacles; sheer will and brute force are no longer enough
to survive. The question you're facing now is
a new one: How can you elevate yourself to a position of true
leadership?

What if I told you that by reading this book and applying its core
principles, you could eliminate all of your business-related
frustrations? That you could have great
employees at all levels who share your vision, communicate with each
other, solve their own problems, and demonstrate accountability?
That your organization could not
only run seamlessly, but also have the potential to scale up as large as
you see fit?

I am telling you that, and you can. Believe it or not, you
already have everything you need to make those changes.
Put this system to work and you
will accomplish all of the above, just as businesses across many
different industries have been doing for
years.

This book is not another silver bullet management book or
flavor-of-the-month strategy. It contains no theory.
It's based on real-world
experience, practical wisdom, and timeless truths.
More importantly, it works.
Through hands-on experience, I
have developed a practical but thorough method to help strengthen and
reenergize your business.

If you're like most entrepreneurs, you're probably experiencing one or
more of five common frustrations:

      1. Lack of control: You don't have
enough control over your time, the market, or your company.
Instead of controlling the
business, the business is controlling
you.

      2. People: You're frustrated with
your employees, customers, vendors, or partners.
They don't seem to listen,
understand you, or follow through with their actions.
You're not all on the same
page.

      3. Profit: Simply put, there's not
enough of it.

      4. The ceiling: Your growth has
stopped. No matter what you do, you can't
seem to break through and get to the next level.
You feel overwhelmed and unsure of
what to do next.

      5. Nothing's working: You've tried
various strategies and quick-fix remedies.
None have worked for long, and as
a result, your staff has become numb to new initiatives.
You're spinning your wheels, and
you need traction to move again.

Granted, a small minority of entrepreneurs and business owners do not
suffer from these frustrations. They run their
businesses using core disciplines that arrange the many moving parts of
their organization into a well-oiled machine.
Some of these owners are naturals
who don't even realize they're doing anything special.
Most of us, though, aren't so
lucky.

What I teach business leaders is simple, but not simplistic.
I help them melt away the five
common frustrations by implementing the same basic tools that those
successful organizations employ. As a result, business
leaders come out feeling more in control, happier, and less stressed.
Their organizations are more
profitable, more focused, and staffed by great
employees.

You are not your business. Your business is an entity in and
of itself. Yes, you created it, but in order
to find success, you have to turn it into a self-sustaining organism.
Reaching the next level requires
more than just a product or service, or a simple determination to
succeed. You need skills, tools, and a
system to optimize your people, processes, execution, management, and
communication. You need strong guiding principles
that will work for your company day in and day
out.

This book contains all the tools and components that make up the
Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS).
EOS is a holistic, self-sustaining
system that addresses the six aspects of your business.
Master the individual elements of
EOS and you'll
be able to integrate them into a powerful framework that will help you
gain traction and realize the vision you've always had for your
company.

This operating system didn't hit me like a lightning bolt; I've been
refining it in the real world for over 20 years.
It came through countless
real-world hands-on experiences one lesson at a time.
My journey has been a quest to
understand what makes great entrepreneurs and businesses so successful.
Through turning around and then
selling my own family's business, my involvement in The Entrepreneurs'
Organization, and learning from my many amazing mentors, I've been
blessed with many experiences, challenges, and lessons.
In the last 11 years alone, I've
completed more than 1,300 full-day sessions with the leadership teams of
over 120 entrepreneurial organizations.
That adds up to over 10,000 hours
of hands-on planning, teaching, coaching, facilitating, and solving
leadership problems; EOS is the culmination of all that hard
work.

My typical client is an entrepreneurial small to mid-size organization
(\$2 million to \$50 million in revenue with 10 to 250 employees),
growth-oriented, willing to change, and willing to be vulnerable (as in
being open-minded, willing to admit weaknesses, and willing to face
reality). If that describes you, you're
starting with everything you need. You will not have to
master an endless stream of new techniques.
Instead, you'll learn what
successful organizations do to run a frustration-free business and gain
renewed energy, focus, and excitement for your business.
Join me on this journey to better
control your business and bust through the ceiling---to have better
balance, better results, more fun, and more
profitability.

At this very moment, people who follow The EOS Process are out there
running very successful businesses. On average, my clients'
businesses grow revenue by 18 percent per year.
In addition, unlike many
theoretical authors, I too am out there somewhere, working with a
leadership team hands-on and applying, testing, and proving these tools.
I am an entrepreneur like you and
have been since I was 21 years old. This is not management
theory. EOS is working every
day.

Be careful what you wish for---with this system, you'll get it.
After EOS, you'll make quicker
decisions to change people, strategy, systems, and processes where
necessary.
It will help you reduce needless
complexity, identify and remove distractions, identify and troubleshoot
any problems, and keep you and your people engaged and focused on a
single vision.

The Six Key Components of the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) go
right to the roots of the six most important aspects of your business
and strengthen them, eliminating all of your symptomatic issues by
solving the real ones. EOS is a method---even a way of
life---that will help you crystallize your vision and build a strong
organization. By first understanding and then
implementing what you learn, you will be able to accurately monitor the
pulse of your company and know how it's really
doing.

At some point on this journey, you're likely to say, as every client
does, "Hey, this stuff is simple." That's because it is.
If you're looking for the next
fashionable MBA methodology, this isn't it.
EOS consists of timeless,
practical, universal principles that have been tested in almost every
kind of organization. What's dramatically new is the
integration of these best practices into a complete system for
organizing and operating your business that will endure for decades to
come.

I have tremendous respect for you, the entrepreneur.
You take risks, you drive the
economy, you keep your country at the forefront of innovation, and you
sacrifice everything to fulfill your dreams.
As a result, you create most of
the jobs and give other people the opportunities to live their dreams.
My passion and purpose is to help
you succeed. Now, let's begin this journey at
the end by envisioning what your company could look like after
implementing EOS.
