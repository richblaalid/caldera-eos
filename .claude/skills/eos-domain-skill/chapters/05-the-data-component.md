# Chapter 5: The Data Component

CHAPTER 5

THE
DATA COMPONENT

SAFETY IN NUMBERS

Picture a small plane
flying over the Atlantic Ocean. Halfway across, the captain
announces, "I've got bad news and I've got good news.
The bad news is that the gauges
aren't working. We are hopelessly lost, I have no
idea how fast we're flying or in what direction, and I don't know how
much fuel we have left. The good news is that we're making
great time!"

Does that sound at all familiar? That's how most entrepreneurs run
their organizations. They're flying blind with no data
to let them gauge where they are, where they are going, or if they are
heading in the right direction. But they always remain
optimistic.

Doubts can eat away at you. If you're a typical business
owner, you often wake up at 2:00 a.m. with an uneasy feeling.
You feel you can't accurately
measure the pulse of your business. To take that pulse, you
walk around the office the next day and talk to five different people.
In the process, you waste a lot of
your time and other people's, and after all that talking, what you have
are subjective opinions, not hard data. Only factual information
can provide the basis for productive discussion and
decision-making.

This chapter is designed to help you formulate and manage your data to
let you take the pulse of your business consistently and accurately so
that you can then take effective action. You will no longer be
managing assumptions, subjective opinions, emotions, and
egos.

You will gain the power of being able to manage your business through a
chosen handful of numbers. These numbers will allow you to
monitor your business on a weekly basis, quickly showing which
activities are on track or off track. Once you have tracked
those numbers for a while, you will achieve the valuable ability to see
patterns and trends to predict the future.

For the Data Component, you will be introduced to a time-tested tool
that will allow you to quantify your company's results.
It's called a Scorecard, and once
you learn to use it, you'll be able to accurately read the pulse of your
business. With hard data in hand, you'll
sleep better at night. Ultimately, you will have the
ability to let go of the vine and be better connected than ever.
In addition, you will reach the
point where everyone in your organization has a number, a meaningful,
manageable measurable. This will give them clear
direction and increase productivity.

SCORECARD

According to an old business maxim, anything that is measured and
watched is improved. The concept of managing through a
Scorecard has been around for a long time. The idea has been
expressed through many different terms. It's been called a
dashboard, flash report, scoreboard metrics, measurables, key
performance indicators, smart numbers, and so on.
Whatever you call it, it's a
handful of numbers that can tell you at a glance how your business is
doing.

The unfortunate reality is that most organizations don't have a
Scorecard. They lack activity-based numbers
to review on a regular basis. They might rely on a
P&L
(profit and loss statement) to tell them the score, but by then it's too
late to make corrections. A profit and loss statement is a
trailing indicator. Its data comes after the fact, and
you can't change the past. With a Scorecard, however, you can
change the future.

Let's look at someone who managed the most seemingly unmanageable beast
of all using a Scorecard. In his book,
*Leadership*, Rudolph Giuliani says
in a chapter aptly titled "Everyone's Accountable, All of the Time" that
one of the first things he did when he took over as mayor of New York
City was to introduce CompStat. CompStat is a multilevel
management tool that allows officers of the New York Police Department
(NYPD) to report specific crime numbers on a daily or weekly
basis.

Giuliani says it enabled local precinct commanders to see patterns and
trends, and then to react and deploy officers where necessary.
In the past, the NYPD had merely
tracked the number of arrests and the response times to 911 calls, but
these are trailing indicators. By the time these numbers were
received, quarterly or even annually, the pattern of crime would have
changed. CompStat tracked crime activity on
a daily and weekly basis, which Giuliani says allowed the NYPD to take
the pulse of crime activity and thus gain the ability to prevent crime
rather than just report it.

In eight years, murder figures went down by almost 70 percent and
overall crime went down by about 65 percent.
In 1996, CompStat won the
Innovations in Government Award from the Kennedy School of Government at
Harvard University. Now many cities are using the same
type of tool. After the success of CompStat,
Giuliani went on to unveil a citywide Scorecard called CapStat, which
allows a detailed performance evaluation of 20 city
agencies.

My business mentor, Sam Cupp, showed me how he used his Scorecard to
take the pulse of his companies, which totaled over \$300 million in
sales. In his teachings, he forced me to
do the same with my business.

In my first business, I was able to manage the entire company using 14
numbers. How many numbers you need to track
depends on the type of business you have. Every company's
Scorecard is different. With over 400 EOS clients, there
are over
400 different Scorecards. Your Scorecard will be unique to
you and your organization. The following exercise will show
you a step-by-step process for creating a Scorecard that fits your
unique business.

STEP 1

Spend an hour with your leadership team. Imagine you're on a
desert island somewhere. None of you can talk to anyone,
access e-mail, or talk on the phone. All you have is a piece
of paper with a handful of numbers on it. These numbers must allow
you to have an absolute pulse on your business.
What are all of the numbers that
must be on that piece of paper? Decide and list all of the
categories that you'd need to track on a weekly basis to have that
pulse.

These categories should include items such as weekly revenue, cash
balances, weekly sales activity, customer satisfaction/problems,
accounts receivable and payable, and client project or production
status, to name a few.

As a rule of thumb, you should end up with five to 15
numbers---hopefully closer to five. There is such a thing as
too much information, so keep it simple. Once you've identified
all the categories, you then plug them into your Scorecard template.
On the previous page is a sample
template in a spreadsheet format. As you can see, you list the
categories under the Category heading:

STEP 2

In the left-hand column, list who is accountable for each of the
numbers. Only one person is ultimately
accountable for each, and it's usually the person heading up that major
function. This is the person who must
deliver that weekly number to the organization, not the person who
simply enters the number. For example, the head of sales and
marketing is accountable for hitting the sales-activity numbers, not the
finance person who fills out the Scorecard each
week.

STEP 3

Decide and fill in what the expected goal is for the week in each
category. Now that your V/TO and vision are
clear, the goal numbers in your Scorecard should be tied directly to
your one-year plan.

STEP 4

Put next week's date in the first date column in preparation for
filling in your Scorecard next week.

STEP 5

Decide who is accountable for collecting the numbers and fill in the
Scorecard every week for the leadership to review.
Decide how that person will
receive the numbers from each member.

STEP 6

Use it! You must review your Scorecard
every week to ensure that you're on track for your vision.
The real magic of using a
Scorecard is not limited to managing it on a weekly basis.
You will soon see 13 weeks (three
months) at a glance, which enables you to see patterns and trends.
From there the numbers roll,
meaning that the first week will drop off the Scorecard as the 14th week
is added. Make sure you keep the numbers
that drop off for future reference and historical
data.

THREE SCORECARD RULES OF THUMB

      1. The numbers in the Scorecard
should be weekly activity-based numbers, not the type of high-level
numbers you see in a profit and loss statement (P&L).
Remember, this Scorecard is not a
P&L. It's based on numbers showing
activity and telling you whether you're on track for a strong P&L.
In other words, your Scorecard
*predicts* your P&L.
What are activity-based numbers?
To help clarify, let's look at a
couple of examples.

           One category would be new revenue/sales.
If you only monitor revenue as it
comes in, you'll react to downslides too late.
Look at your sales process and
follow the steps as far back as you can. Typically you'll find
that each step can be measured with a number.
Take them in order, starting with
the first step. Measure the number of the leads
generated, the number of contacts, the number of appointments scheduled,
the number of appointments attended, the number of proposals, and/or the
number of closes. You decide how far back you want
to measure because you can chase the process all the way back to the
first step.

           Say, for instance, you choose number of new leads generated
and track that number in the Scorecard. By knowing the number of
leads you have, you can see how many of the leads turn into contacts,
how many contacts turn into appointments, and so on.
By understanding these formulas
and these ratios, you'll be able to predict the number of closes two,
three, and sometimes four months down the road.
This ultimately gives you the
ability to predict and tells you how many leads you need to develop
today.

           Another example of activity-based numbers is client
satisfaction. If you merely track customer
complaints or lost customers, that's too late as well.
Instead, go to the first step in
the process---finding out what factors drive both happy and unhappy
customers. For instance, you might do a
proactive numerical survey, such as asking three questions that require
a number-based answer every time you close the business or deliver the
product. As a result,
you'll
create leading indicators that allow you to track how you're doing.
For instance, if, on average, you
receive an 8.5 rating out of 10 in a certain area of your delivery and
suddenly see an average rating of 7 for a series of three weeks, you
know that a problem is brewing somewhere. You then have the
opportunity to solve it before you potentially lose the
customer.

      2. The Scorecard is much more of a
proactive tool, helping you to anticipate problems before they actually
happen. However, you still need to look at
either monthly or quarterly financial statements and monitor a budget on
a monthly or quarterly basis.

      3. When managing a Scorecard, many
clients find value in red-flagging categories that are off track.
Red-flagging occurs when one of
your numbers does not hit or exceed the goal for the week.
Shade that number so it stands out
in the Scorecard, usually using the color red.
This can be programmed in an
electronic spreadsheet or done manually. This creates better
focus and awareness on that number, which creates more urgency in the
weekly meeting.

Your Scorecard will evolve over the next several months.
Assuming you've taken a good first
cut, your categories should be about 85 percent right.
That is close enough at this
point. As your Scorecard is brought to
life in the succeeding chapters, it will evolve to 100 percent.
On average, three months have to
pass until it evolves into a tool you love.

The Scorecard should cause an organizational shift.
Your leadership team will become
more proactive at solving problems because you'll have hard data that
not only points out current problems but also predicts future ones.
By solving them, you're assuring
them that you're on track with your vision. In order to solve a
problem, you must know the source of the number in the Scorecard;
therefore you can go directly to the root cause and create better
accountability and clarity with your people.
That leads to the second part of
the Data Component.

MEASURABLES

What gets measured gets done. Complete mastery of your Data
Component is achieved when you boil the organization's numbers down to
the point where everyone has a single meaningful, manageable number to
guide them in their work. This number will enable leaders to
create clarity and accountability throughout their team.
With a completed Scorecard, you
can track high-level numbers down to a single person as the
source.

EVERYONE HAS A NUMBER

The founder and chairman of a large Michigan mortgage company and a
leading online mortgage lender once gave a talk at our Entrepreneurs'
Organization Chapter. This was 16 years ago, when I was
running my first company and he had 75 employees.
He's a fanatic about measuring
everything; at one point he told us that "everyone has a number."
He went on to explain how every
employee in his organization has a number, even his receptionist.
Hers was two, as in, "two rings
good, three rings bad."

His speech was a wake-up call for me. Back at my office, I
came up with and implemented a number for everyone.
I have since taught this
discipline to every client, and it has produced tremendous
results.

Dale Carnegie's book *How to Win Friends & Influence
People* contains an example illustrating
the power that numbers can generate among your people: Charles Schwab
ran Bethlehem Steel Company in the early 1900s, and he had a mill
manager whose people weren't producing their work quota.
One day Schwab asked him, "How is
it that a manager as capable as you can't make this mill turn out what
it should?" The mill manager didn't have an
answer. He had tried everything.
This conversation took place at
the end of the day, just before the night shift came on.
Schwab asked the manager for a
piece of chalk and asked the nearest man how many heats (i.e., batches
of refined steel) his shift had made that day.
The man said six.
Without another word, Schwab
chalked a big figure six on the floor and walked
away.

When the night shift came in, they saw the six and asked what it meant.
The day people explained that
Charles Schwab, the big boss, has asked how many heats they'd made, and
chalked the number down on the floor. The next morning, Schwab
walked through the mill again, and he found the night shift had rubbed
out the six and replaced it with a big seven.
When the day shift reported to
work that morning, they too saw the seven chalked on the floor, and
decided that they would show the night shift a thing or two.
The crew pitched in with
enthusiasm, and when they quit that night, they left behind them an
enormous 10. It wasn't soon before this mill,
which had been lagging way behind in production, was turning out more
work than any other plant.

That shows the power of giving everyone a number.
In fact, there are eight distinct
advantages to everyone having a number.

      1. Numbers cut through murky
subjective communication between manager and direct
reports. As an example, where the
old response between sales manager and salesperson regarding last week's
sales activity was a vague "Great! Things are picking up,"
the new number-based answer is crystal clear: "I got three."
If three is good for that company,
then last week was great. If they needed to get 10, there is
an issue to solve. Better to solve it now than two
months from now when it shows up as poor revenue in the P&L.
Numbers aren't just for the
person. They become a
communication
tool between manager and direct report, creating the basis of
comparison, unemotional dialogue, and, ultimately,
results.

      2. Numbers create
accountability. When you set a number,
everyone knows what the expectation is. Accountability begins
with clear expectations, and nothing is clearer than a number.
For example, if in the accounting
department the people's expectations are "collections," that is unclear.
However, if they are supposed to
keep accounts receivable days below 40, balance below \$100,000, or aged
receivable less than \$50,000, that is a clear expectation.
The people know exactly what their
target is.

      3. Accountable people appreciate
numbers. Wrong people in the
wrong seats usually resist measurables. Right people in the
right seats love clarity. Knowing the numbers they need to
hit, they enjoy being part of a culture where all are held accountable.
It creates an esprit de corps with
everyone pitching in to make the company a success because right people
want to win.

      4. Numbers create clarity and
commitment. When an employee is
clear on his or her number and agrees that he or she can achieve it, you
have commitment. There is no gray area.
A great example is the number
Nordstrom uses with its salespeople: sales per hour.
The number shows up on their
paychecks and perks are tied to it. Nordstrom salespeople
know exactly what their sales expectations are all the way down to an
hourly basis.

      5. Numbers create
competition. Charles Schwab was able
to create competition by making a target number known to all teams.
Sure, they might experience some
discomfort and a little stress, but there is nothing wrong with a little
pressure.

      6. Numbers produce
results. Similar to the way
Rudolph Giuliani helped turn a city around, you can create terrific
results. If the customer service
department's expectation is zero unresolved customer issues, by hitting
this number, you will achieve the ultimate result of customer retention
and satisfaction. Or if your customer service people
are accountable for ancillary sales, and they know \$1,000 in daily
ancillary sales will reach the total ancillary sales goal, you'll
typically hit it, or at least do better than if you don't provide this
number. What gets watched
improves.

      7. Numbers create
teamwork. When a team composed of
the the right people in the right seats agree to a number to hit, they
ask themselves "how can we hit it," creating camaraderie and peer
pressure. When a team of technicians are
challenged to perform their service in four hours or less collectively,
they will all pull together to figure out ways to achieve that number.
The ones that aren't pulling their
weight and hitting the number will be called out by the other team
members that are.

      8. You solve problems
faster. When an activity-based
number is off track, you can attack it and solve the problem
proactively, unlike with an end-result based number that shows up after
it's too late to change it. In addition, the use of hard data
cuts through all of the subjective and emotional opinions that create
murkiness and lengthen the amount of time it takes to make the right
decision.

Todd Sachse of Sachse Construction immediately saw the value of
everyone having a number but struggled to persuade his leadership team
to embrace the concept and understand the value as well.
They assumed a backlash from the
employees. He asked me to present the above
advantages to them, and Todd's people have now come to embrace the idea
of numbers. His superintendents achieve 15-day
turnaround times on punch lists. His accounting people keep
accounts receivable under 30 days. Even his receptionist
opens and hands out mail in
less than four hours. He attributes everyone having a
number as one of the key reasons that his organization grew 50 percent
the following year.

If you're still stuck, a great place to find numbers for your people is
your completed Accountability Chart. Look at each of the five
roles for each function. One, two, or three of those five
roles can be measured by a number. For example, let's say a
project manager's five major roles are as
follows:

     • complete projects on time

     • achieve margin goal on each job

     • client satisfaction

     • weekly reporting in on time

     • achieve quality standards

Of these five, you can measure on-time, margin, client satisfaction,
and possibly quality standards.

With the tabulation of data, your organization accomplishes the third
essential component of gaining traction. With the vision clear,
people in place, and data being managed through a Scorecard, you're
creating a transparent organization where there is nowhere to
hide.

Your company is open and honest. Any obstacles that stand in the
way of achieving your vision will be apparent.
Your job is to now remove these
barriers and solve the issues holding you
back.
