# Chapter 6: The Issues Component

CHAPTER 6

THE
ISSUES COMPONENT

DECIDE!

The fourth essential
component of gaining traction is having the discipline to face and solve
your organization's issues as they arise. When the vision is
clear, the people are in place, and you're managing data, you will
inevitably find out what's holding you back. Successful companies
solve their issues. They don't let them linger for
weeks, months, and years at a time. Problems are like
mushrooms: When it's dark and rainy, they multiply.
Under bright light, they diminish.
In an organization where there is
nowhere to hide, the problems are easily illuminated.
EOS will create that strong
light.

It's human nature to put off making a hard decision.
If given the option, most people
would prefer not to address an issue and hope that it goes away on its
own. This reluctance to act can be a
drag on growth and is extremely frustrating to watch.
As Napoleon Bonaparte said,
"Nothing is more difficult and therefore more precious than to be able
to decide."

Your ability to succeed is in direct proportion to your ability to
solve your problems. The better you are at solving
problems, the more successful you become. This is not a new
discovery. In the classic book
*Think & Grow
Rich*, Napoleon Hill cited a study
that analyzed 25,000 people who had experienced failure.
Lack of decision, or
procrastination, was one of their major causes of failure.
In contrast, analysis of several
hundred millionaires revealed that every one of them had the habit of
reaching decisions promptly and changing them
slowly.

Most leadership teams spend their time discussing the heck out of
everything but rarely solving anything. What is draining your
energy is not having a lot of work to do; rather, it's having unresolved
issues. You're about to learn a process
that helps leadership teams quickly dig to the root of an issue, discuss
solutions, and then decide---therefore keeping them moving forward and
giving them energy by pulling up the anchors holding them back.
The one statement that summarizes
this chapter best is a maxim my dad taught me long ago: "It is less
important what you decide than it is that you decide."
More is lost by indecision than by
wrong decisions.

When most new clients solve their major issues in the early stages of
the process, they typically say, "That one has been around for years,"
or, "We've been trying to solve that issue forever."
Each unresolved issue is an
incomplete project weighing down your organization and holding you back.
You only have so much capacity,
and these unresolved issues take up time and energy.
Ultimately, you or your
organization will implode under the burden. By solving these issues,
you'll free up capacity, creating more time and
energy.

In this Issues Component chapter, you'll learn the next two EOS tools
to wield against obstacles holding your company back.
The first is a discipline of
creating an Issues List. The second is the Issues Solving
Track. Once you set them up, you'll knock
those obstacles down.

THE ISSUES LIST

It's normal to have issues. The sooner you can admit that you
have them and not view that as negative thinking or some kind of a
weakness, the faster you will move forward. The good news is that
there are only a handful of issues in the history of business.
The same ones crop up over and
over again. What changes is your ability to
solve them. The key is to create an
environment that smokes them out.

A vital first step is creating a workplace where people feel
comfortable calling out the issues that stand in the way of your vision.
To do this, your leadership team
must be comfortable with this type of environment.
My only expectation with every EOS
client is that they be open and honest with each other.
To the degree that your leadership
becomes open and honest, you will end up with an open and honest
organization. As goes the leadership team, so
goes the company. If the leadership team is open and
honest, issues will flow freely.

No one has ever died from being open about issues.
You have nothing to lose and
everything to gain. Start with your leadership team
meetings, and this behavior will trickle down throughout the entire
organization. The result is an environment in
which everyone feels comfortable being open and honest about
everything.

If, on the other hand, the leadership team is not healthy, the
organization never will be. In *The Five Dysfunctions
of a Team*, Patrick Lencioni makes the
point that a high level of trust is the foundation of what makes teams
healthy and functional. In *Managing by
Values*, authors Ken Blanchard and
Michael O'Connor write that "communication happens naturally when you
make the work environment safe." Trust creates an open culture in
which everyone feels comfortable talking about issues as they
arise.

You cannot achieve this openness if people in the organization fear
losing their jobs or some other terrible ramification.
Therefore, trust starts with you.
You set the tone by openly
admitting mistakes and issues and then working together to solve them.
Everyone must know that it's okay
to raise issues as long as they are
corrected.

The Issues List is meaningless if no one ever puts anything useful on
it. The way to get meaningful issues
on the list is to create open and honest teams.
When your Accountability Chart is
complete, your organization will be made up by a handful of teams.
Each must be healthy, starting
with your leadership team. As each team becomes healthier,
you will notice issues flowing more freely and the trust level
increasing.

With an open and honest organization, the Issues List becomes a tool
that creates a discipline to keep all of your issues out in the open and
organized in one place. There should be three types of
Issues Lists in your organization:

      1. The Issues List in your
Vision/Traction Organizer (V/TO). These are all company
issues that can be shelved beyond 90 days. These issues are tackled
in future quarterly meetings. The issues that are not a big
enough priority for this week or this quarter must be stored somewhere
so that you don't lose sight of them. The V/TO Issues List is
the place for that. This list will include issues as
diverse as new product ideas, key employee issues, technology needs,
office relocation, capital needs, and the need for HR policies.
They'll go there if this is not
the quarter to solve them because you have bigger fish to
fry.

      2. The weekly leadership team
Issues List. The time frame on these
items is much shorter. These are all of the relevant
issues for this week and quarter that must be tackled at the highest
level. These issues will be resolved in
your weekly leadership team meetings. You should not be
solving departmental issues. These will typically be more
strategic in nature. If it can be solved at a
departmental level, push it down. Leadership issues include things
as diverse as company Rocks being off track, a bad number in the
Scorecard, key employee issues, major client difficulties, and process-
and system-related problems.

      3. The departmental Issues
List. These issues are on a
more local level. These include all the relevant
departmental issues for the week that must be tackled during the weekly
departmental meetings. The sales team might have hitting
call numbers, presentations, closing business, marketing, and
presentation materials on their list, while the operations team might
have fulfilling orders, purchasing, customer complaints, and low
production numbers on theirs.

A client shared a great idea that he used when he was having a hard
time getting the people in his department to be open and honest in the
identification and resolution of issues. For his next meeting, he
made it mandatory that everyone bring two issues.
If someone did not have two, he or
she could not attend the meeting. He said it was the best meeting
his team had ever had. With the floodgates opened, they
are healthier than ever.

With an open and honest culture and the three Issues Lists clear,
issues will start flowing freely. You can now compartmentalize each
issue onto the appropriate list. Each issue that arises in your
organization has a place, which means you have to start working on
solving them. The most effective way to do that
is by following the Issues Solving Track.

THE ISSUES SOLVING TRACK

When addressing issues, leadership teams spend most of their time
discussing the heck out of everything, rarely identifying anything, and
hardly ever solving something. It's truly an epidemic within the
business world.

Most teams suffer from different challenges when solving issues.
The common ones include fear of
conflict, lack of focus, lack of discipline, lack of commitment, and
personal ego. There are scores of different
issue resolution models and approaches, but most people find them too
complex and time-consuming. Some of the more detailed conflict
resolution and problem-solving techniques require hours of preparation
and mountains of paperwork. There is a better, faster, and
more efficient way. After observing this phenomenon
for many years, I created a simple tool that allowed my clients to
resolve their issues. It's called the Issues Solving
Track.

The Issues Solving Track consists of three
steps:

      1. Identify

      2. Discuss

      3. Solve

To start, you must first examine your Issues List and quickly decide on
the top three issues to be solved. Do not make the mistake
of starting at the top of your Issues List and working your way down.
If the most important issue is
seventh on the list, you will rarely handle that many issues in one
sitting, and as a result you will not get to the most important one.
In addition, when you take them in
order of priority, a few issues will fall off the list because they turn
out to be symptoms of the real issue you solved.
For example, say you decide that
the most important issue is that the handoff process from sales to
operations is ineffective. After solving it, you might
realize that the first and second issues on the list---frustration with
the sales team and slow project starts---were also symptoms of the same
thing. As a result, they go away on their
own.

Assuming you've decided what the three most important issues are, start
with the most important and follow the Issues Solving
Track:

STEP 1: IDENTIFY

Clearly identify the real issue, because the stated problem is rarely
the real one. The underlying issue is always a
few layers down. Most of the time, the stated
problem is a symptom of the real issue, so you must find the root of the
matter. By batting the issue back and
forth, you will reach the true cause.

Plan on getting a little bit uncomfortable.
Most causes of real issues are
people. The discussion can hit close to
home if either someone on the leadership team or one of his or her staff
is responsible. You have to be able to talk about
the elephant in the room. That is why trust is so important.
You have to become more vulnerable
with each other and be willing to be straight about real problems.
Remember the greater
good.

The time spent identifying the real issue can take far longer than the
time used for the second and third steps, and that's okay.
That's because the root problem
may have multiple symptoms. Put another way, sometimes you
will spend most of your time identifying the issue.
As a result, the Discuss and Solve
steps will take just a few minutes because the real issue is now
clear.

Here's an example. The stated issue is that John's
customers are too demanding. John runs the warehouse and has
been complaining that, between ordering and receiving products,
customers are expecting too much with a two-day delivery time.
By discussing the issue, you go
from thinking that John's customers are too demanding to thinking you
might not be communicating with your clients as well as you should.
As you dig further, you might find
that maybe the process isn't working. But through more
digging, you discover that it's *John* that isn't
working.

All the way down at the bottom, you realize that John is in the wrong
seat. The reality is that the customer's
two-day delivery request is very reasonable, and if you don't achieve
it, the company will start losing those customers.
John is just incapable of
organizing, managing, and getting product out on time.
He doesn't have the capacity
(remember GWC). So, assuming you've now clearly
identified the real issue---John is in the wrong seat---you can now move
on to discuss what to do. Sometimes this process feels a bit
like peeling an onion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    One helpful context when identifying is to understand that there
are three types of issues. One is a true problem that has to
be solved. The second is information that
needs to be communicated and agreed to by the team.
The third is an idea or
opportunity that needs feedback, brainstorming, insight, and/or a green
light from the team. As a result, in the identify step,
it's the issue owner's responsibility to make it clear what type of
issue it is and what is needed. For instance, if it's the second
type of issue, the owner starts IDS by stating, "I just want to make
sure that everyone is clear and agrees on the new pricing policy."
This will help the entire team
know the objective and makes for much more efficient issue
resolution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 2: DISCUSS

Most people spend the majority of their time at this step.
They rarely identify the real
problem before they start discussing, and thus they rarely solve
anything. They just discuss everything ad
nauseam, and they actually think they are being
productive.

The task of clearly identifying an issue enables you to stay focused on
the issue at hand and avoid tangents. Once the issue is
clearly identified, don't be afraid to suggest a solution.
Sometimes you don't have to spend
much time in the discussion step, because the issue is so clear and the
solution is so obvious. In the above example of John, what
more is there to discuss? The solution is to people-analyze
John, sit down with him, determine if he can correct his issues, and
then follow the three-strike rule. Taking a shot at voicing
a solution forces others to react, which prompts a fuller
discussion.

In its simplest form, the discussion step is everyone's opportunity to
say everything they have to say about the issue.
You get everything on the table in
an open environment where nothing is sacred.

Everyone should say what they believe but they should say it only once,
because more than once is politicking. In the discussion step,
you'll need to fight for the greater good, not what is best for you or
your department. If an issue is starting to hit
home and the solution causes you discomfort, you must try not to push
the solution in a direction that's more favorable to you or
your
team. If you do, you aren't fighting for
the greater good of the company; you're just protecting your turf.
You should have healthy conflict
and let the best solution come to light, even if it causes you some
pain.

Likewise, when the discussion starts to become redundant, it's time to
move to Step 3. But before we do, let's have a
quick word on tangents.

TANGENT ALERT!

RE/MAX First was suffering from veering off on tangents more than any
other client I had ever had, so much so that I was running out of ways
to help them. As a last resort, I looked up the
definition of the word in the dictionary and wrote it in big block
letters in front of them. When they came back from break,
this is what they saw:

Tangent:

Diverging from an original purpose or course; see
irrelevant

That did the trick. To this day, they are one of the
best at staying focused, and are now much more productive.
Incidentally, after that meeting,
they went on to have their most profitable year in the history of the
company.

The number one reason most leadership teams spend the majority of their
time talking is tangents. I've observed teams that go on as
many as 10 during the discussion of one issue.
I know this because I write each
of them down and then share them when the team is done discussing.
That can be a great wake-up call.
They'll start out talking about
increasing sales, and five tangents later they're talking about
letterhead. The conversation goes like this:
Sales are down; we have to increase sales. Then someone brings up
the salespeople and what they are doing, and from there we discuss one
of the salespeople, Jack. Then the subject of Jack leads to
that of Jack and Sue in accounting not getting along.
This leads to the question, "Did
Sue send the letter to customers who are past due?"
which raises the question, "Did
she use the new letterhead?"

You don't have to sit there helplessly. When someone starts to
go on a tangent, get in the habit of saying "Tangent Alert!"
It's a friendly triggering
mechanism that
keeps you on track. If the tangent is a real issue,
but not relevant to the current one being discussed, put it on the
Issues List and get to it in order of
priority.

Upon the completion of the discussion step, all of your options, data,
ideas, solutions, and concerns regarding the issue at hand will be out
in the open. This enables you to move to Step
3---making the issue go away forever.

STEP 3: SOLVE

The solve step is a conclusion or solution that usually becomes an
action item for someone to do. The item ends up on the To-Do
List, and when the action item is completed, the issue goes away
forever.

George Perles, the head football coach of the Michigan State Spartans
from 1983 to 1994, once gave a dinner talk at a function I attended.
He shared a mantra from his days
as an assistant coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers during their heyday in
the 1970s. He said, "We made every decision
like we were going to the Super Bowl," and they ended up winning the
Super Bowl four times. That is what every leadership team
needs to do. You should make all of your
decisions as though you are going to your own Super Bowl---as though you
were achieving your vision.

It's important to note that you cannot jump right to solving issues
without implementing the Vision Component first.
If your Vision/Traction Organizer
(V/TO) is not complete and your leadership isn't on the same page,
you'll never solve issues well. It's like driving a car, not
having a destination, and making turns randomly.
If you don't know where you're
going, you can't make decisions on which way to turn.
Where decisions may have been
difficult in the past, this step becomes much easier when your vision is
clear.

Solving issues takes time. By solving issues now, you'll save
time exponentially across departments by eliminating all future
symptomatic issues. The old days of shoving issues to
the side so you can make it to next week have to come to an end.
Jury-rigging problems with duct
tape and twine will become a thing of the past.
To build a well-oiled machine, you
have to solve issues for the long term in accordance with your
vision.

Three types of resolutions will emerge from an issues-solving session.
The first is when the issue is
solved and requires action. For instance, "John is going to
revise the accounts receivable past-due letter to include the new
language." In this case, John takes the
action item and completes it, and it is solved.
The second is when the issue is
merely awareness, and the conclusion is that everyone concurs with that
awareness. For instance, "Okay, so we all
agree that meetings will start on time." The third is when the
issue needs more research or facts. In this case someone is
assigned an action item to do the research and bring it to a subsequent
meeting. For example, "Bill will gather the
client data for the last two years, and we will make the issue a top
priority in next week's meeting."

As you master this third step of the Issues Solving Track and become
stronger at solving your own issues, your team must internalize the
following 10 important aspects of solving
issues.

THE 10 COMMANDMENTS OF SOLVING ISSUES1. Thou Shalt Not Rule by
Consensus

On a healthy team where the vision is clear and everyone is on the same
page, eight out of 10 times, everyone will agree with the solution.
However, sometimes they won't, and
someone needs to make the final decision. Consensus management
does not work, period. Eventually, it will put you out of
business. Not everyone will be pleased in
these situations, but as long as they have been heard and if the team is
healthy, they can usually live with it and will support the decision.
From there, you must present a
united front moving forward.

One of the worst cases of consensus management was a company being run
by its next generation of family members. The company's growth was
stagnant, and some tough decisions needed to be made to restore
profitability. In our first few sessions, every
time a hard decision needed to be made, the team would either retreat
out of fear of hurting someone's feelings or someone would say, "Let's
vote." This had been going on for years.
They were some of the nicest
people you could ever meet. Yet they would come to the next
session complaining about all of the same issues and how nothing was
working. After a year of forcing more
openness and a few very uncomfortable sessions for some people, one of
the owners finally stepped up as the integrator and started to make the
tough decisions. Finally, the ship is starting to
turn around for them.

In countless cases of tough decisions, I've observed that in instances
when the team was divided, if the integrator had gone along with the
majority, it would have been the wrong decision.
In a *Fortune* magazine issue on
decision-making, Jim Collins is quoted as saying that in his years and
years of research, "no major decision we've studied was ever taken at a
point of unanimous agreement."

2. Thou Shalt Not Be a
Weenie

The solution will always be simple; it's just not always easy to
implement. You must have strong will, have
firm resolve, and be willing to make the tough
decision.

3. Thou Shalt Be
Decisive

Remember the study from *Think & Grow
Rich*. The 25,000 people who
failed lacked the ability to make decisions and procrastinated, whereas
the several hundred millionaires made decisions quickly and changed them
slowly. Remember, it's less important what
you decide than it is that you decide ... so,
decide!

4. Thou Shalt Not Rely on Secondhand
Information

You cannot solve an issue involving multiple people without all the
parties present. If the issue at hand involves more
than the people in the room, schedule a time when everyone can attend.
Tyler Smith of Niche Retail calls
these "pow-wows." When someone brings him an issue
involving others or secondhand information, he says, "Time for a
pow-wow" and pulls everyone involved together and solves
it.

5. Thou Shalt Fight for the Greater
Good

Put your egos, titles, emotions, and past beliefs aside.
Focus on the vision for your
organization. You will cut through the
candy-coating, personalities, and politics. If you stay focused on
the greater good, it will lead you to better and faster
decisions.

6. Thou Shalt Not Try to Solve Them
All

Take issues one at a time, in order of priority.
What counts is not quantity but
quality. You're never going to solve them
all. The faster you understand that,
the better your odds are of staying sane. Solve the most important
one first, and then move on to the next.

7. Thou Shalt Live with It, End It,
or Change It

This is another great lesson from my dad. In solving an issue, you
have three options: You can either live with it, end it, or change it.
There are no others.
With this understanding, you must
decide which of the three it's going to be.
If you can no longer live with the
issue, you have two options: Change it or end it.
If you don't have the wherewithal
to do those, then agree to live with it and stop complaining.
Living with it should, however, be
the last resort.

8. Thou Shalt Choose Short-Term Pain
and Suffering

Both long-term and short-term pain require suffering.
Remember the "36 hours of pain"
rule, and solve your problem now rather than
later.

9. Thou Shalt Enter the
Danger

The issue that you fear the most is the one you most need to discuss
and resolve.

10. Thou Shalt Take a
Shot

Taking a shot means that you should propose a solution.
Don't wait around for someone else
to solve it. If you're wrong, your team will
let you know. Sometimes the discussion can drag
on because everyone is afraid to voice a solution even though someone
may have it right at the tip of his or her tongue.
Often, a team will discuss an
issue for far too long. They'll be stuck and no one will
be offering solutions, when suddenly the quietest person in the room
might speak up and suggest something. There might be a
silence, then someone who says, "That's a good idea" and everyone
agrees. Don't be afraid to take a shot.
Yours might be the good
idea.

One important point: When the issue is completely solved, someone must
make the solution statement. For example, in the case of John
being in the wrong seat, someone states the solution: "Barbara will sit
down with John and discuss the warehouse seat issue, offer him the
assistant manager seat, and see if he wants it.
If not, we will part ways."
You'll know after the statement
that the problem is solved because you'll hear the sweet sound of
agreement in the room. The issue is then owned by someone
(in this case, Barbara), it's added to the To-Do List, and it gets done.
Occasionally after the solution
statement, someone will say, "Wait a minute, that is not what I heard,"
and the discussion will begin again. That's okay.
You're creating clarity and
getting everyone on the same page. Be
patient.

The Issues Solving Track always follows the three steps: identify,
discuss, and solve. The acronym for the track is IDS.
As you move forward in mastering
the Six Key Components, IDS will become an important aspect of your
day-to-day running of the business. From now on, when faced
with an issue, you simply "IDS it."

The power and simplicity of IDS is demonstrated by two EOS clients who
do business together. They were facing some tough
issues, so they scheduled a meeting. They sat down in the
conference room, and one walked up to the whiteboard and wrote
this:

The other smiled, and they went to work and resolved all of their
issues. Not only does the Issues Solving
Track work internally, but it works externally as well.
The ability to "IDS it" became a
common language between the two of them, and it's helped them not only
to achieve resolution, but also to get there
faster.

THE PERSONAL ISSUES SOLVING SESSION

Building a healthy team is not always a smooth process.
If a team is not opening up, it
might be because two individuals don't get along.
They may even be at odds with one
another. When this situation occurs, you
must resolve the tension. Sometimes it's the only obstacle
holding you back from being a functional, cohesive team.
And you need a functional,
cohesive team to be a healthy, growing
company.

A personal issues solving session usually provides the remedy.
This is an opportunity for the two
people involved to come together to clear the air and resolve their
differences. It's recommended that you have a
third party facilitate the session.

      1. Have each person prepare and then
share with the other what he or she believes the other's three greatest
strengths and three greatest weaknesses
are.

      2. List all the issues and solve
them.

      3. List the action items from the
solutions.

      4. Meet 30 days later to make certain
that the action items have been
accomplished.

Nine out of 10 times, their differences will be resolved.
In rare cases, they can't be, and
you have a tough decision to make because one must go for the greater
good of the team. The analogy of the dying plant
applies here. Once you cut off the dying limb,
the plant flourishes, just as your team will.
This is sometimes a hard pill to
swallow, but, assuming you've conducted the personal issues solving
session and exhausted every other option, it's what's best for the
health of the team. Hopefully, the dismissed member
can be relocated to another team in the
organization.

Even in a healthy company, though, not everyone is going to get along
like best friends. We are talking solely about
building productive business relationships, as well as any personal
issues severe enough to hinder the team from being frank about the
company's needs.

With the Issues Component clear, you can create an open and honest
organization that comfortably calls out issues and uses the Issues List
and the Issues Solving Track to document and eliminate them.
You're growing closer to reaching
your full potential as a business.

You are now ready to work on the most neglected component of all, the
secret ingredient of building a successful, well-run business:
process.
