# Chapter 10: Getting Started

Chapter 10

Getting
STARTED

At this point, you're
probably eager to put these tools to work in your organization.
To help you get the fastest
results in the shortest amount of time, I'll outline the exact process
that I use to implement each EOS tool with our clients.
Ultimately, these will strengthen
the Six Key Components.

The objective of this book is to teach the Six Key Components and the
tools that will strengthen each of them. It's written in a
specific order using The EOS Model, basically top to bottom and right to
left, in an attempt to keep the learning and understanding as linear as
possible. While this is the best way to
write this book and create understanding, the most effective order of
implementation of each tool is different.

The objective of this chapter is to provide the exact steps in order.
Following this process has proven
to be the most efficient way to get the fastest results.
Keep in mind that you can
implement them in any order you choose, but I highly recommend you go
straight down the list.

You might want to first check the overview of The EOS Process on
page
63.
After hands-on implementation with
over 120 companies personally and an additional 300 with our team of
implementers, I've learned the most effective way to proceed.
I will first share the tool in the
sequence and then the reason for that order.
I won't get into the specific
how-tos, as they're already explained in the earlier
chapters.

You've learned a total of seven main tools in this book, with an
additional 12 secondary supportive tools. Each stands on its own,
but when they're combined, you have
a complete and holistic system for running your organization.
As I've mentioned before, I
suggest you implement each of the following tools only within your
leadership team first. Make sure you and your leadership
team have mastered them before rolling them out to the rest of your
organization. Any chink in the armor of your
leadership team will show up as a gaping rip to the rest of your people,
so this step is vital. Once your team has fully embraced
them, I'll show you how to introduce them to the rest of your
company.

The seven main tools are listed in the order of recommended
implementation, along with the 12 secondary tools that go with
them:

      1. Accountability Chart (which
includes People Analyzer and GWC)

      2. Rocks

      3. Meeting Pulse (which includes IDS,
Level 10 Meeting, Quarterlies, and Annuals)

      4. Scorecard

      5. V/TO (which includes core values,
core focus, 10-year target, marketing strategy, three-year picture, and
one-year plan)

      6. Three-Step Process
Documenter

      7. Everyone Has a
Number

ACCOUNTABILITY CHART (WHICH INCLUDES PEOPLE ANALYZER AND
GWC)

Begin by creating your Accountability Chart.
The reason we start here with
every client is that the chart goes to the root of most issues.
First, you need to take a big step
back and determine the right structure for your organization.
Then you can put the right people
in the right seats. Through this initial strategy, you
will smoke out any people and accountability issues that are holding you
back.

When complete, you'll have absolute clarity on who is accountable for
what. If this tool is set in place
before you apply the remaining tools, they'll be much more potent and
effective because you'll have created a world of accountability.
For instance, with a completed
Accountability Chart in place, you'll draw up your V/TO with your
leadership team with a more complete, realistic vision and
plan for
your organization. Without an Accountability Chart,
you won't know who clearly owns what. In this environment,
teams tend to shoot a little higher, and there's less productive
discussion and debate due to increased bravado and lack of true
ownership.

ROCKS

Once your Accountability Chart is complete, you should move to the
second tool: setting Rocks. Once you know who is accountable
for what, you set better Rocks. You want your team to evolve
toward setting and achieving great Rocks every 90 days.
The other reason Rocks are the
second tool to implement is that it focuses your team on the most
important priorities quickly and gets you to work on accomplishing
them.

The reality is that the first time around, you will set mediocre Rocks
and only achieve about 50 percent of them. This has been
historically accurate for over 10 years with our clients.
Within two or three quarters of
setting and achieving Rocks, though, you and your team will become
experts at Rock setting and achieving, accomplishing a minimum of 80
percent collectively each quarter.

MEETING PULSE (WHICH INCLUDES IDS, LEVEL 10 MEETING, QUARTERLIES, AND
ANNUALS)

With your Accountability Chart in place and your leadership team
laser-focused on their Rocks, the third tool to implement is the Meeting
Pulse, specifically the 90-minute weekly Level 10 Meeting.
This new habit is a bit
uncomfortable at first. You'll probably take four to eight
weeks to really become comfortable with it. Still, the tool forces
your team to single out what's important every week and start solving
the right problems.

Implementing the weekly Level 10 Meeting relies on the proper use of
one of the secondary tools, IDS. The Level 10 Meeting forces you to
use this tool to identify, discuss, and solve all relevant issues.
This will help you gain immediate
traction.

As for your quarterly and annual meeting pulse, you simply start those
based on where you are in the calendar year.

SCORECARD

With momentum building, the fourth main tool to implement is the
Scorecard. You need to develop your Scorecard
into a powerful predictive tool, a process that takes one to three
months. Soon you and your team will have
an absolute pulse on your business. During this
developmental process, you will create real accountability as you
identify the right activity-based numbers to measure and clearly
identify the person who ultimately owns the number.
This will create instant results
and ownership.

V/TO (WHICH INCLUDES CORE VALUES, CORE FOCUS, 10-YEAR TARGET, MARKETING
STRATEGY, THREE-YEAR PICTURE, AND ONE-YEAR
PLAN)

The first four main tools create a strong foundation of traction,
accountability, and a platform from which to execute your vision.
That leads to the fifth tool, the
V/TO. One of the secrets to The EOS
Process is that we always start with traction first and then vision.
This means that we first build a
strong foundation for execution with the first four main tools, then we
build the vision. Frankly, the vision work is
relatively simple when there is little or no discipline and
accountability. Without a nuts-and-bolts
foundation, devising a vision is easy. That's why it's so fun
for many consultants who spend their time doing two-day strategic
planning sessions.

Doing the tough work of putting a strong foundation of accountability
in place leads to much more intense and productive planning work.
You can have great discussions of
what the *right* plan is for the
organization, because your people are now being measured and held fully
accountable for the objectives of the
company.

Still, a question I'm often asked is, "How can you create an
Accountability Chart and set Rocks before you know what your vision is?"
The truth is, most organizations
have a pretty good idea where they're going already.
After all, they're not exactly
starting from scratch.

The real questions to ask are these: How are you going to get the best
bang for your buck with these tools? Where will you get the
most impact in the shortest period of
time? What I've learned over the last
decade with over 400 companies is that this approach is
it.

THE EOS FOUNDATIONAL TOOLS

The Accountability Chart, Rocks, Meeting Pulse, Scorecard, and V/TO are
known as the EOS foundational tools. Implementing them into
your entire company produces 80 percent of the results.
As you expand the use of these
tools, it's important to introduce them one tier at a time until each
person in that tier understands and embraces them, just as we did with
the leadership team.

Every company moves at its own pace. Our fastest client, a
50-person organization, rolled out the foundational tools from top to
bottom in six months. In contrast, our slowest client, a
70-person company, needed over three years. Neither is bad or
good---you can only move as fast as you're able to absorb the changes.
A good rule of thumb is about a
year. Also, a larger company will take
longer than a smaller company. By the same token, a company with
more tiers (layers) takes longer than a company with less.
To date, our smallest client has
three people and our largest has 1,700.

One important note for companies with multiple locations: It's vital
that the manager at the off-site location fully embraces and understands
each foundational tool before rolling them out to the next tier in his
or her location. Many times, leadership team
members need to be present at locations to help teach, guide, and show
support for the tools. So, if you have multiple
locations, it adds an inherent level of complexity to your organization.
It's just the reality of your
business model. Accepting this reality is the
first step to solving it. Plan on spending the necessary
time at these locations until full implementation is achieved.
This additional time can be
achieved through physical visits, conference calls, and webinars.
All have worked well with our
clients, and every company is different in terms of which approach works
best.

THREE-STEP PROCESS DOCUMENTER

When you have the foundational tools fully implemented in your entire
company and everyone is clear and has bought into them, the next step is
documenting
and training your core processes using the sixth main tool, the
Three-Step Process Documenter. This is typically a six- to
12-month process, including documentation and fully training
everyone.

One additional note is that some clients do begin implementing this
tool prior to full implementation of the foundational tools.
A simple rule of thumb is that if
you feel you're on track with the implementation of the previous tools
and your leadership team has the capacity, then go ahead and overachieve
by getting a jump start on implementing this
tool.

EVERYONE HAS A NUMBER

The seventh and final main tool is that everyone must have a number.
With most of our clients, this is
the last domino to fall. While a highly effective tool,
without the first six main tools in place, it's less effective due to a
lack of follow-through that stems from a lack of accountability,
discipline, and strong management. However, with a strong
foundation in place, everyone having a number in your organization gives
you increased results.

ONGOING IMPLEMENTATION AND REINFORCEMENT

Once the above seven main tools are implemented along with the
additional 12 supportive tools, it's important to know what ongoing
implementation, reinforcement, and management look like, because getting
your head around all the tools at once is a lot and can get
overwhelming.

Here's a snapshot: Imagine all of the above-mentioned tools fully
implemented. Every quarter, you're in a
full-day quarterly session with your leadership team, resolving all key
issues, reviewing last quarter's Rocks and setting next quarter's Rocks,
getting better and better at it every 90 days.
Every year, you participate in a
highly effective two-day annual planning session, challenging every
aspect of your V/TO and putting a rock-solid plan in place for the
coming year, with everyone on the same page.

You're hiring, firing, reviewing, rewarding, and recognizing all of
your people around core values and using the People Analyzer for all
people decisions. As your
organization grows, you're making the necessary evolutionary changes to
your Accountability Chart, always focused on structure first and people
second, ensuring the right people are in the right
seats.

You participate in a weekly Level 10 Meeting with your leadership team,
reviewing your Scorecard to assure all numbers are on track.
You review Rocks to make sure all
priorities are on track. You're solving all relevant issues
for the week. As a result, you're executing well
as a team. In addition, each department is
doing the same.

Every 90 days, you deliver a quarterly state-of-the-company meeting.
That keeps everyone in your
company on the same page, sharing the same vision.
Each person is setting and
achieving his or her individual Rocks. Your company is growing.
You're achieving your goals and
building a great company.

This picture can be achieved. It is just a matter of
implementing each tool in the order in which I've laid them out for you
in this chapter.
