# Discussion Prompts for Hard Conversations
## Prepared for Caldera VTO Session #1

---

## Context

These prompts are based on the January 26 partner conversation transcript. They're designed to help Rich facilitate productive discussions around sensitive topics without avoiding the elephants.

**Principle:** Name the tension, don't dance around it. But do it constructively.

## The Visionary Seat

### Opening the Discussion
> "John, you've said you want more leadership involvement than just being 'the sales guy.' Wade and I have heard that. Before we assign any seats, help us understand—when you say leadership, what does that look like day-to-day for you?"

### If John Claims Visionary
> "Let's look at what the Visionary role actually entails in EOS: big ideas, culture, major relationships, future direction. You've got strengths in relationship building and vision when you believe in something. You've also been honest that trust needs rebuilding. Given where we are, does it make sense to formally assign this now, or build toward it over the next quarter?"

### If There's Disagreement
> "I'm hearing different views. Let's name it: John, you want this role. Wade and I have concerns about trust and consistency. That's the real issue. What would need to happen for us to feel confident assigning it?"

### Creating a Path Forward
> "What if we said: John, you take Sales with explicit room to contribute visionary ideas. We review in 90 days. If pipeline is healthy and communication has been consistent, we revisit the Visionary seat. Does that feel like a fair test?"

## Trust and Past Behavior

### Acknowledging Without Rehashing
> "We talked last week about things that created tension—the Slack venting, inconsistency, feeling like we didn't know where each other stood. I don't want to relitigate that. But I do want to name it: we're carrying that into this room. Can we agree to judge each other on what happens from today forward?"

### If Past Issues Come Up
> "I hear you bringing up [specific incident]. That hurt. I'm not dismissing it. But if we stay there, we won't move forward. Can we put it on the Issues List as 'communication patterns' and commit to solving it through the structure we're building today?"

### The Drinking / Judgment Issue (If Needed)
> "John, you were honest last week about some personal struggles affecting your work. I respect that. From a business perspective, what we need is: consistent behavior, especially in client-facing situations. Can you commit to that? And if you're struggling, can you tell us before it becomes a problem?"

## Compensation and Equity

### If John's Salary Comes Up
> "Compensation is on the Issues List, not today's agenda. But let me say this: we're not trying to punish anyone. We're trying to align pay with value delivered and company health. Once we're clear on roles and the business is stable, we revisit comp. Fair?"

### If There's Resentment
> "I hear frustration about the salary cut. I made that call because we were burning cash without results. That doesn't mean you're not valued—it means the business was in trouble. Now we're defining clear roles with clear accountabilities. If you hit them, comp follows."

---

## Role Clarity and Overlap

### Surfacing the Problem
> "One pattern from last year: we've been stepping on each other. John feels like his leadership was sidelined. Wade doesn't know priorities. I'm stretched across everything. That's why we're doing this. When we leave today, each of us should know exactly what we own—and what we don't."

### When Someone Wants Multiple Seats
> "You've said you want [Seat A] and [Seat B]. Let's GWC both. Do you honestly have the capacity to do both well right now? Or are you saying you want the option to contribute to both? Those are different things."

### Creating Lanes
> "Here's what I'm proposing: John owns Sales and everything that goes with it—pipeline, CRM, closing. Wade owns Operations and Delivery. I own Finance and run the business as Integrator. If we need to cross into each other's lanes, we ask first. Does that feel right?"

---

## The Team Problem

### Opening the Discussion
> "We've all said it: we're disappointed with the team's energy, initiative, and AI adoption. That's not about any one person—it's about the culture we allowed to develop. Today we're setting the values that fix that. But that means we have to be willing to make hard calls downstream."

### Linking Values to Action
> "If 'Ownership' is a core value, then the next step after this session is evaluating the team against it. Some people will step up. Some won't. Are we all ready to follow through on that, including the uncomfortable conversations?"

### The "Country Club" Comment
> "John, you said it felt like people thought this was a country club. I think we all feel some version of that. The question is: what do we do about it? Values help. Direct feedback helps. Being honest about expectations helps. But only if we all commit to enforcing it."

---

## Wade's Role in the Dynamic

### Bringing Wade In
> "Wade, you've been quieter on some of this because you came on full-time later. But you're in this now. What's your honest read on the partnership dynamic? What do you need from John and me to do your best work?"

### The Alex Situation (If It Comes Up)
> "John mentioned that Alex doesn't think you like him. That's worth knowing, even if it's not true. Is there something there we should address, or is it just misperception?"

### Wade's Priorities Problem
> "You've told us you need clear priorities. That's on John and me for not providing them. After today, your seat will have defined accountabilities. If we're still failing to give you clarity, call it out in L10. That's what it's for."

## Moving Forward Questions

### At the End of a Hard Discussion
> "We just went through something real. On a scale of 1-10, how resolved does this feel? If it's below a 7, what's still hanging?"

### Before Moving to Next Topic
> "Are we good here, or is there more we need to say before we move on?"

### If Someone Goes Silent
> "[Name], I'm not hearing from you. What's your reaction to what just happened?"

### Closing the Session
> "We covered heavy stuff today. Before we end: Is there anything you're walking out of here feeling unresolved about that we should either address now or commit to addressing soon?"

---

## Emergency Prompts

### If Things Get Heated
> "Let's pause. We're getting emotional, and that means this matters. Let's take five minutes. When we come back, let's try to hear each other instead of defend."

### If Someone Shuts Down
> "I notice you've gone quiet. That can mean a lot of things. Are you processing? Frustrated? Holding something back? Whatever it is, I'd rather hear it."

### If You (Rich) Get Triggered
> "I need a minute. What you said hit something for me. Let me collect my thoughts."
> Then: Take a breath. Don't respond in reaction. Come back with curiosity, not defense.

### If the Conversation Stalls
> "We're stuck. Let's name what's blocking us. What's the fear or concern that's keeping us from moving forward?"
