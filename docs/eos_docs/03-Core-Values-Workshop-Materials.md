## Purpose of Core Values in EOS

From Traction:
> "Core values are a small set of vital and timeless guiding principles for your company. They define your culture and who you truly are as people. Once they're defined, you must hire, fire, review, reward, and recognize people based on these core values."

**For Caldera specifically:** This is how you stop the "country club" problem. Values become the rubric for performance—not just lines of code or hours worked.

## Evidence From Your Conversations

Themes that emerged from the partner transcript and interview:

### What You All Value (Explicit)
- **Honest, hard work** — John: "An honest day's work, right? You went in and did something somebody else doesn't want to do."
- **Directness** — All three committed to "radical transparency"
- **Accountability** — The whole EOS push is about this
- **Believing in what you sell** — John can't sell something he doesn't believe in
- **Client success over internal comfort** — Shift from "best place for nerds" to "delivering value"

### What's Been Missing (Pain Points)
- **Clear communication** — Bottled-up resentments, Slack rants
- **Following through** — "Since September" issues not addressed
- **Taking initiative** — Team waiting to be told what to do
- **Owning problems** — Complaints without solutions

### What You Want to Be True
- A team you can sell / believe in
- Pride in Caldera as a company
- Work equals reward, cut and dry
- People who care, not just show up

## Exercise 1: The "Who" Exercise (10 min)

Each partner independently writes down:

1. **Name one person at Caldera (current or past) who exemplifies our best qualities. What makes them stand out?**

   _________________________________
   
   _________________________________

2. **Name one person who didn't fit—without naming them. What was the mismatch?**

   _________________________________
   
   _________________________________

3. **What 3 words describe Caldera at its best?**

   _________________________________

**Share and discuss:** What themes emerge?

## Exercise 2: The "Hell Yes / Hell No" Sort (15 min)

For each draft value, each partner rates:

| Value | John | Wade | Rich |
|-------|------|------|------|
| Purposeful Innovation | ✓/? | ✓/? | ✓/? |
| Fearless Exploration | ✓/? | ✓/? | ✓/? |
| Balance | ✓/? | ✓/? | ✓/? |
| Relentless Pursuit of Clarity | ✓/? | ✓/? | ✓/? |
| High Standards and Taste | ✓/? | ✓/? | ✓/? |
| Ownership | ✓/? | ✓/? | ✓/? |

✓ = Hell Yes, keep this
? = Unsure or needs rewording
✗ = Doesn't resonate

**Discussion rule:** If anyone says ✗, it's out or needs major revision.

## Exercise 3: Define the Behavior (20 min)

For each value you keep, complete:

### [VALUE NAME]

**In one sentence:** This means _______________

**Someone living this value would:**
- Do: _______________
- Say: _______________
- Not do: _______________

**Example from Caldera:**
- A time someone demonstrated this: _______________
- A time someone violated this: _______________

**Hiring question:** "Tell me about a time when you _______________"

**Review prompt:** "Did this person consistently _______________ this quarter?"

## Sample Value Definitions (Reference)

These are examples—adapt to your language.

### Ownership
> **Definition:** You see a problem, you own it. No waiting for permission. No "that's not my job." You follow through until it's done or explicitly hand it off.
> 
> **Living it:** Noticing a client concern and addressing it before being asked. Seeing a process gap and proposing a fix.
> 
> **Violating it:** "Nobody told me to do that." Flagging an issue but not following up. Passing the buck.

### Relentless Clarity
> **Definition:** We don't let vague commitments slide. We ask the hard questions. We define success before we start. We say what we mean.
> 
> **Living it:** "What does 'done' look like?" "Who owns this?" "When will it be complete?"
> 
> **Violating it:** Nodding along in a meeting but not understanding. Accepting fuzzy requirements. Avoiding the direct question.

### Direct Communication
> **Definition:** We say the hard thing kindly, not the kind thing vaguely. We address issues face-to-face (or call), not in Slack rants.
> 
> **Living it:** "I have a concern about X—can we talk through it?" Giving feedback in the moment.
> 
> **Violating it:** Venting to a third party instead of the person. Sending passive-aggressive messages. Silence when something's wrong.

### Client-First Mindset
> **Definition:** Client success is the point. Internal comfort is secondary. We'd rather have a hard conversation that helps a client than an easy one that doesn't.
> 
> **Living it:** Pushing back on client requests that won't serve them. Going beyond scope when it matters.
> 
> **Violating it:** Doing the minimum to close a ticket. Prioritizing internal preferences over client needs.

### High Standards
> **Definition:** Good enough isn't. We deliver work we're proud to put our name on. We call out mediocrity—in ourselves and each other.
> 
> **Living it:** Reviewing your own work before submitting. Flagging quality issues even when it's uncomfortable.
> 
> **Violating it:** Shipping something you know has issues. "It's fine" when it's not.

### Honest Effort
> **Definition:** We show up and do the work. No coasting. No entitlement. Results come from effort, and effort is visible.
> 
> **Living it:** Consistent delivery. Transparent about what you're working on. Asking for help when stuck.
> 
> **Violating it:** Going through the motions. Hiding behind busyness. Expecting reward without contribution.

## Values to Avoid

Watch out for values that are:

1. **Aspirational but not real** — "Innovation" when no one innovates
2. **Generic** — "Integrity" (everyone claims this)
3. **Contradictory to reality** — "Work-life balance" if you expect 60-hour weeks
4. **Too many** — If you have 7+, you have none
5. **Un-actionable** — If you can't hire/fire around it, it's not a value
