## Red Flags to Watch For

Check the assessments for these warning signs:

- [ ] Someone says "Yes" to everything (not being honest)

- [ ] All three want the same seat (conflict incoming)
- [ ] No one wants a critical seat (gap to solve)
- [ ] "Obligated" seat matches "Energizes" seat (confused or forced)
- [ ] Concerns section reveals unspoken tension
