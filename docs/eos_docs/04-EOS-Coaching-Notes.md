## The V/TO in 60 Seconds

The Vision/Traction Organizer (V/TO) answers eight questions that define where you're going and how you'll get there:

**Vision Side (Where we're going):**
1. Core Values — Who we are
2. Core Focus — Why we exist, what we do best
3. 10-Year Target — Our big, long-term goal
4. Marketing Strategy — Who we serve, how we're unique

**Traction Side (How we get there):**
5. 3-Year Picture — Medium-term targets
6. 1-Year Plan — This year's goals
7. Quarterly Rocks — 90-day priorities
8. Issues List — Obstacles to solve

**For Tuesday:** You're tackling Core Values, Core Focus, 10-Year Target, and starting the Accountability Chart. That's the foundation.

## GWC Explained

Every person in every seat must pass the GWC test:

| Letter | Question | What It Means |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **G** - Get It | Do they intrinsically understand this role? | Not "can they learn"—do they ALREADY get it? |
| **W** - Want It | Do they genuinely want this job? | Not "are they willing"—do they DESIRE it? |
| **C** - Capacity | Do they have the capacity to do it well? | Time, energy, knowledge, emotional bandwidth |

**Key insight:** All three must be YES. If any is NO, the person is in the wrong seat.

**How to facilitate:**
- Read each criterion aloud
- Give people time to answer honestly
- A "No" isn't failure—it's clarity
- Better to surface misalignment now than force it

## The Accountability Chart

### Why It's Different from an Org Chart
- Org charts show hierarchy and reporting
- Accountability Charts show **who owns what function**
- Every box = one person, one set of responsibilities
- "When more than one person is accountable, nobody is"

### The Three Core Functions (Every Company)
1. **Sales & Marketing** — Generating business
2. **Operations** — Delivering the product/service
3. **Finance & Administration** — Managing money and infrastructure

### The Integrator Role
- Harmonizes the major functions
- Runs the day-to-day business
- Holds the leadership team accountable
- Removes obstacles
- Manages the P&L
- Makes the tie-breaking decisions
- "The glue that holds it together"

### The Visionary Role (Optional but Powerful)
- Big-picture thinker
- Idea generator (10 ideas a week, 1 good one)
- Culture keeper
- Big relationship manager
- Operates on emotion and instinct
- Sees the future

**Key dynamic:** Visionary and Integrator are opposite and complementary. One without the other creates imbalance.

## How to Explain the Visionary Question

From your Scott conversation, this is the sensitive topic. Here's how to frame it:

> "The Visionary role in EOS isn't about being in charge or having the title. It's about a specific set of responsibilities—big ideas, culture, major relationships, future direction.
> 
> Not every company has a distinct Visionary seat. Many have an Integrator who handles visionary functions as part of their role.
> 
> Today, we're going to figure out what's right for Caldera right now. That might mean assigning someone, or it might mean leaving it open while we build trust and clarity on the operational side first."

**If John pushes for Visionary:**
> "I hear that you want to contribute at that level. Help me understand—what specific responsibilities are you asking for? Let's make sure we're talking about the same thing."

**If there's resistance to deferring:**
> "Scott's advice was that when there's trust to rebuild, getting clear on operations first creates a foundation. The Visionary role can emerge from that. Does that feel fair?"

## IDS: How to Solve Issues

When you hit a conflict or issue, use the IDS framework:

### Identify (5 min max)
- What's the REAL issue? (Not the symptom)
- Say it in one sentence
- "The issue is _______________"

### Discuss (10-15 min)
- Everyone shares their perspective
- No interrupting
- No solving yet—just understanding
- "What's your view?"

### Solve (5-10 min)
- What's the decision?
- Who owns it?
- When is it done?
- Write it down

**Facilitator tips:**
- Cut off discussion if it's circular
- "We've been discussing for 15 minutes. What's the decision?"
- If unresolvable, add to Issues List and set a revisit date

## Common Facilitation Challenges

### "We're all equal partners—why should one person be Integrator?"
> "The Integrator role isn't about being more important. It's about someone having clear accountability for running the business day-to-day. You're all still owners with equal say. But operationally, one person needs to be the tie-breaker."

### "I can do multiple seats."
> "In EOS, one person can sit in multiple seats IF they can pass GWC for each one. But be honest—do you have the capacity to do all of them well? Or are you spreading yourself thin?"

### "This feels like we're demoting people."
> "We're not demoting anyone. We're getting clear on who does what. Right now, you've been stepping on each other because nothing was defined. This is about enabling everyone to succeed in their lane."

### "What if no one wants a seat?"
> "Then we have a gap to solve. Either someone needs to grow into it, or we need to hire for it, or we need to structure differently. But ignoring it doesn't make it go away."

### "Can we revisit this?"
> "Absolutely. The Accountability Chart should be reviewed quarterly. We're defining what's right for the next 90 days, not forever."

## Key Quotes to Use

### On Accountability
> "When more than one person is accountable, nobody is." — Gino Wickman

### On the Visionary/Integrator Dynamic
> "A visionary's lust needs to be counterbalanced with a manager's prudence and discipline."

### On Core Values
> "Core values already exist within your organization—they've just been lost in the day-to-day chaos. Your task is merely rediscovering what they are."

### On Structure
> "What is the right structure to move your organization forward in the next six to 12 months?"

### From Your Conversation with Scott
> "Right now, you all are having problems with clarity of action first. Visionary is looking at what is tomorrow, and we are not ready to have that discussion yet because we're not clear on how we're delivering what we're doing today."

## Your Role as Facilitator

### Do:
- Keep time
- Ask open-ended questions
- Capture decisions visibly
- Call for breaks when tension rises
- Push for specificity ("What does that mean exactly?")
- Summarize and confirm understanding

### Don't:
- Dominate the discussion
- Solve everything yourself
- Let one person hijack
- Avoid the hard conversation
- Rush through critical decisions
- Forget to capture outputs

### When You Have a Strong Opinion:
1. State it clearly
2. Then ask: "Push back on that"
3. Listen to the response
4. Make the call if needed (Integrator's job)
