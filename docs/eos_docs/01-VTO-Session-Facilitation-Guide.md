# Caldera VTO Session #1 — Facilitation Guide
## Tuesday, February 4, 2025 | 4 Hours | Facilitator: Rich

## Session Purpose

This is not just an EOS kickoff—it's a **partnership reset**. The goal is to walk out with:
1. **Clear accountability** — Who owns what, with no overlap
2. **GWC alignment** — Names in seats based on honest self-assessment
3. **Shared vision** — Core values, purpose, and direction we all believe in
4. **Trust rebuilt** — Through radical transparency and direct conversation

---

## Pre-Session Checklist

- [ ] GWC self-assessments collected from John and Wade
- [ ] Room/video setup confirmed (no distractions)
- [ ] This guide printed or accessible
- [ ] Whiteboard or shared digital workspace ready
- [ ] Water, snacks, breaks planned
- [ ] Phones silenced, Slack notifications off

---

## Ground Rules (Read Aloud at Start)

> "Before we begin, let's agree on how we'll operate today:
> 
> 1. **Radical transparency** — Say what you actually think. No bottling.
> 2. **No defensiveness** — Hear each other out before responding.
> 3. **Forward-looking** — We're not here to rehash. We're here to build.
> 4. **One person, one seat** — Every function needs a single owner.
> 5. **GWC is honest** — A 'No' isn't failure. It's clarity.
> 6. **Decisions stick** — What we agree to today, we commit to.
> 
> Can we all commit to these?"

Wait for explicit verbal agreement from each person.

## Block 1: Opening (15 min)

### Facilitator Script

> "We're here because we all said we want this to work. Last week's conversation surfaced things we'd been holding back. Today, we turn that into structure.
> 
> Our goal: Walk out of here knowing exactly who owns what, with values we all believe in, and a vision we can sell—to ourselves, to the team, and to clients.
> 
> This isn't about titles or ego. It's about putting the right people in the right seats so Caldera thrives.
> 
> [Read Ground Rules above]
> 
> Before we dive in—any concerns about today? Anything we need to clear first?"

**Note:** If anyone surfaces a concern, acknowledge it and either:
- Park it on the Issues List for later
- Address it briefly if it's blocking participation

---

## Block 2: Core Values (45 min)

### Why This Matters
Core values define who you hire, fire, review, and reward around. They're the behavioral contract. This is how you stop having the "country club" culture problem.

### Existing Draft (from Rich's previous work)
1. Purposeful Innovation
2. Fearless Exploration
3. Balance
4. Relentless Pursuit of Clarity
5. High Standards and Taste
6. Ownership

### Facilitation Process

**Step 1: Individual Reflection (5 min)**
> "Looking at these six draft values, each of us write down:
> - Which 3-4 resonate most?
> - Any that feel wrong or missing?
> - One person on our team who exemplifies our best values"

**Step 2: Share & Discuss (25 min)**

Go around the room. Each person shares their picks. Look for:
- **Overlap** — What do all three agree on?
- **Tension** — Where is there disagreement?
- **Gaps** — What's missing that matters?

For each value kept, define the behavior:
> "If someone lives this value, what do they actually DO?"

**Step 3: Finalize (15 min)**

Narrow to **3-5 values** with clear behavioral definitions.

### Suggested Definitions (Adapt Based on Discussion)

| Value | Definition (What It Looks Like) |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| **Ownership** | You see a problem, you own it. No waiting for permission. No "that's not my job." You follow through until it's done. |
| **Relentless Clarity** | We don't let vague commitments slide. We ask the hard questions. We say what we mean and mean what we say. |
| **Purposeful Innovation** | We don't chase shiny objects. Every experiment serves a client outcome or business goal. |
| **High Standards** | Good enough isn't. We deliver work we're proud to put our name on. |
| **Direct Communication** | We say the hard thing kindly, not the kind thing vaguely. Radical transparency over comfortable silence. |

### Warning Signs to Watch For
- Values that sound good but no one can give a specific example of
- Values that describe aspirations, not current reality
- More than 6 values (less is more)

### Capture Format
```
CALDERA CORE VALUES

1. [VALUE NAME]
   → [One sentence definition]
   → [Behavioral example]

2. [VALUE NAME]
   → [One sentence definition]
   → [Behavioral example]
   
...
```

## Block 3: Accountability Chart & GWC (75 min)

### Why This Matters
This is the hardest block. You're deciding who owns what. The tension from the last year—John feeling sidelined, Rich stretched thin, Wade needing priorities—gets resolved here.

**Key principle from Traction:** "When more than one person is accountable, nobody is."

### The Seats to Fill

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │  VISIONARY  │  ← Big ideas, culture, relationships
                    └──────┬──────┘
                           │
                    ┌──────┴──────┐
                    │ INTEGRATOR  │  ← Runs the business, holds accountable
                    └──────┬──────┘
           ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
           │               │               │
    ┌──────┴──────┐ ┌──────┴──────┐ ┌──────┴──────┐
    │    SALES    │ │ OPERATIONS  │ │   FINANCE   │
    └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘
```

### Facilitation Process

**Step 1: Review GWC Assessments (15 min)**

> "Let's look at how we each rated ourselves. I'll share a summary."

[Use the GWC Synthesis document once Rich provides the completed assessments]

**Step 2: Start with the Clear Seats (20 min)**

Start with where there's likely alignment:
- **Head of Sales** — Likely John
- **Head of Operations/Delivery** — Likely Wade
- **Head of Finance** — Likely Rich

For each seat, confirm:
1. Does this person GET IT? (Intrinsically understand the role)
2. Does this person WANT IT? (Genuinely desire it)
3. Does this person have CAPACITY? (Time, energy, ability)

If all three are Yes → Name goes in the seat.
If any is No → Discuss what changes or who else.

**Step 3: The Hard Seats — Visionary & Integrator (40 min)**

This is where the tension lives. 

**Scott's advice from your EOS call:** Don't assign Visionary yet if trust isn't there. It's okay to leave it open short-term while the partnership rebuilds.

**Options to present:**

**Option A: Traditional Split**
- John = Visionary (big relationships, ideas, culture)
- Rich = Integrator (runs the business, accountability)

**Option B: Integrator Only (Scott's Recommendation)**
- Rich = Integrator
- Visionary seat stays open for now
- All three partners contribute visionary ideas, but Rich makes final calls
- Revisit in 90 days

**Option C: Shared Leadership Functions**
- Rich = Integrator + Finance
- John = Sales (focus here to rebuild trust through results)
- Wade = Operations
- Visionary emerges organically based on who demonstrates it

**Discussion Prompts:**

> "John, you've said you want more leadership involvement. What does that look like specifically?"

> "Given where trust is right now, what seat assignment would let us move forward without resentment?"

> "If we don't assign Visionary today, what would need to happen in 90 days to revisit it?"

### If There's Conflict

If you hit a wall:
1. **Acknowledge it:** "We're stuck. That's okay—this is the hard part."
2. **Name the tension:** "It sounds like [X] and [Y] are in conflict."
3. **Use IDS:**
   - **Identify:** What's the real issue?
   - **Discuss:** What are the options? (20 min max)
   - **Solve:** What's the decision?
4. **If unresolvable:** Add to Issues List. Assign a date to revisit.

## Block 5: Issues List & Next Steps (30 min)

### Surface the Issues (15 min)

> "What came up today that we didn't fully resolve? What elephants are still in the room?"

Write them ALL down. Don't filter. Don't solve yet.

Likely issues:
- Visionary seat unresolved
- John's compensation structure
- Team performance and accountability
- Client relationship ownership
- Communication patterns (Slack rants, etc.)
- Process gaps (requirements, delivery)

### Prioritize (5 min)

Vote on top 3 to tackle in the next session or L10.

### Next Steps (10 min)

| Action | Owner | Due |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Finalize V/TO document | Rich | Feb 7 |
| Share results with team | All | Feb 10 |
| Schedule VTO Session #2 | Rich | Before Feb 14 |
| Set up first L10 meeting | Rich | Week of Feb 10 |

### Closing

> "We covered a lot today. Let's do a quick check—on a scale of 1-10, how aligned do you feel leaving this room?
> 
> [Each person shares their number]
> 
> What would make it a 10?"

## Appendix: Facilitator Cheat Sheet

### If Someone Gets Emotional
- Don't shut it down. Emotion means it matters.
- "I hear that this is important to you. Help me understand what's underneath that."
- Take a 5-min break if needed.

### If Someone Goes Silent
- "Wade, you've been quiet on this. What's your take?"
- Don't assume silence = agreement.

### If You (Rich) Have a Strong Opinion
- State it, but then ask: "That's my view. Push back on it."
- You can't facilitate AND dominate. Pick one per topic.

### If Time Runs Short
- Prioritize Accountability Chart over everything else.
- Core Values can be finalized async.
- Issues List is just capture—doesn't need solving today.

### Key Quotes to Use

From Traction:
> "When more than one person is accountable, nobody is."

From your conversation with Scott:
> "Right now, you all are having problems with clarity of action first. Visionary is looking at what is tomorrow, and we are not ready to have that discussion yet because we're not clear on how we're delivering what we're doing today."

From last week's partner conversation:
> "We need to be more focused, and we need to have accountability for the responsibilities across the ownership and leadership. Otherwise, we can't hold our team accountable."

## Post-Session: What Ember Will Need

After Tuesday, share with the AI:
1. Finalized Core Values with definitions
2. Accountability Chart with names in seats
3. Core Focus statement
4. 10-Year Target (confirmed or adjusted)
5. Issues List (full capture)
6. Any decisions that need to be revisited and when

This becomes the foundation for the AI Integrator to track, coach, and hold accountable.
